We got here about 9:15 - Sheila found out she lost the parking ticket - we retraced all our steps - no luck - so I gave her $6.00 for it. Then bought 2 magazines (for 5¢) and felt like a beer 3.25 Ha - haven't even left town yet spent 14.25 - yipes! We will be boarding soon for one of my biggest adventures yet.

That stupid Globus had nothing organized. First of all we had a hell of a time (only in an old dirty airport) finding our luggage then - no rep. to meet us!

The Pope - Pius the VIII - was going to put the crown on him but he grabbed it & put it on himself then crowned Josephine that was 1804! - it gave me an odd feeling - she told all about the wonderful stained glass windows - took us inside - then just back. Of course there is all the Catholic hype - candles burning - for a price etc etc - the Latin liturgy humming - outside all the great statues & gargoyles - where Victor Hugo wrote the \"Hunchback\" - then we went back on the bus & up the Eiffel! - It was wonderful! - the elevator was plenty but we stood up straight - it went fast - we laughed - at the next room the \"attendant\" was smiling & offering if you didn't pay her some money gave her a small coin & she threw it? - I said don't give her any Ruth! - she looked all over",

It was $5.00 for tea no dessert or coffee—oh well—that was about 50¢—oh well—we felt good enough to go on the boat down the Seine—that was wonderful—we had a wonderful lady guide that told us all about every building we along the way and under the 23 bridges! My biggest thrill came when I saw the grim building where they kept Marie Antoinette before they beheaded her—such history—it was overwhelming—I love it! After the boat ride which was an hour—(big about 200 people) we walked you a long way & had an easier time on the metro this time. We came back and I got a bottle of wine & some soup and instant coffee. We had supper the Sun Deck—I had a hamburger and French fries & coffee—without some TV & bed.\n\nThe Louvre—\n\nBoy—we wore ourselves out but what fantastic things we saw!

Then the Venus de Milo stood really close to her and Ruth took pictures. Then they really make you work to see the Mona Lisa. You go past great old Egyptian sarcophagi and up endless of stairs and down a grand spiral way with all these artists. There's in a glass case - Everyone is looking out no pictures. They super old look like they're looking right at you. After the Mona Lisa were stupid and weak (again) and find a nice little restaurant in the Pyramid. I had really good lasagna - mashed potatoes, milk, corn and cherry yogurt. We felt a lot better and walked to the exhibit of Monet, Picasso, Matisse, Modigliani, great Renoir's but the best was a large mural by Monet in 2 rooms of the water lilies - Simply and inspiring!
