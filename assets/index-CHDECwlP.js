May 23rd Airport Omaha 10:20

It's almost time to get on the tiny plane to N.C. Everything taken care of and super! Sheila picked me up at 8:45 - we went home and got my good green skirt and then headed from Kitty. We got here about 9:15 - Sheila found out she lost the parking ticket - we retraced all our steps - no luck - so I gave her $6.00 for it. Then bought 2 magazines (for 5¢) and felt like a beer 3.25 Ha - haven't even left town yet spent 14.25 - yipes! We will be boarding soon for one of my biggest adventures yet. I think I look pretty snazzy - black silk shirt - tan stockings - tan shoes, black ankle socks, silver beads & earrings. My rain coat looked great & also my animal earphones.

11:00 - In the air - this is a small (about 20 pass) plane and I am right next to the propeller in seat 2 F - the plane to Philly leaves at 12:10 so I won't have too much time. It's flight NP 534 -

I think my first outcome go to Paris! What a shock - hope there is food on the plane to Philly - I'm hungry.`,"1992__00002":`There was food - Good too - 9th 3:30 EST - & (putting watch ahead) and in 10 min we land! I met Ruth at 5:00 PM I have a good hour and ½ - Lunch was chicken breast etc and 2 free beers! - Hitting a little turbulence over Philadelphia - Hard to believe this traveled over all those states! - Lots of houses with swimming pools down there - talked to a nice East Indian woman on this plane of good looking young guy going to be an anchor in Alaska on the little one.

7:45 This is wonderful - we are over the ocean! - oh first - what a surprise - I walked in at Philadelphia and here is Ruth sitting there! At first I thought my mind was playing tricks - but she got on earlier flight & met me - great to see her - she had on a red sweater with gold buttons - She didn't get any food on her plane so we ate - I had fried rice tea - something - Got to our gate - got our boarding passes - OK'd - Didn't let us board until 6:06 - it's 5-6 they are passing out dinner - I'm having seafood - listening to wonderful classical music on earphones - really great!`,"1992__00003":`May 22

Monday - My gosh - I've let too much time go by.

Well - let me into him. Went to bed - the meal great - saw a movie "Man in the Moon" good - sort of sad. But just as we settled down to sleep they said "Paris in 20 minutes" - I'm not coming up! We'd been flying 7 hours! Then we set our watches 6 hours ahead! So we got in and our nightmares started! That stupid Globus had nothing organized. First of all we had a hell of a time (only in an old dirty airport) finding our luggage then - no rep. to meet us! Finally little guy went to get us - no luggage back etc. - finally started walking to our hotel - about a 1/2 mile - tired - then got to the hotel waited 20 min - then went to the first hotel the next was - united again. One hour until room ready - it was DIRTY - Ruth gripped at the closet gave us another room - lots bigger & nicer. A great view of the "Jeliga" - all kinds of people - even at 2 in the morning. One night (sun) we heard a woman blood curdling scream! Woke up - she did it twice! - never heard what it was.

Monday we went downtown had our Continental breakfast - very good - then on the bus to`,"1992__00004":`Notre Dame - we had the most wonderful little French tour guide - tiny black haired about 50 & so knowledgeable! Notre Dame church was built in 1163 and took 200 years to build. It's just unbelievable - in the Middle Ages homeless people slept there.

Also we saw the throne Napoleon sat on to be crowned. The Pope - Pius the VIII - was going to put the crown on him but he grabbed it & put it on himself then crowned Josephine that was 1804! - it gave me an odd feeling - she told all about the wonderful stained glass windows - took us inside - then just back. Of course there is all the Catholic hype - candles burning - for a price etc etc - the Latin liturgy humming - outside all the great statues & gargoyles - where Victor Hugo wrote the "Hunchback" - then we went back on the bus & up the Eiffel! - It was wonderful! - the elevator was plenty but we stood up straight - it went fast - we laughed - at the next room the "attendant" was smiling & offering if you didn't pay her some money gave her a small coin & she threw it? - I said don't give her any Ruth! - she looked all over`,"1992__00005":`the city - the next to "La Belle France" a very nice restaurant and made reservation for May 27 at 12:30. It's beautiful up there! 4 wine glasses! - That will be great! We came down - got a "cocktail". We drove around & the little guide talk us more about the Arc de Triumph etc. Home - dropped and got off at the Opera House. Looked at perfumes - didn't see any I wanted unless it was George - so went to an Ex to get Ruth's charged + got a damn migraine! - went back in bed between + sat down, took one of my pills - Home in a cab - back to bed, felt better than Dressed for a great night - wore my floral skirt and black tight top + little black shoes + black muffler. It was a ball! - at first it was SNAFU again - It was raining + we waited for 2 hours for our bus, but had that guy named Misha - we drove up to the Church + he said we could go in. We didn't want to but some did! - So we waited again! Finally got to the top of the hill + walked to the Restaurant - It was so cute - I was in a rare mood + the 2 guitar + accordion players found that out - They came back + I started flirting with Jack + Jacques. They played all old French songs + the`,"1992__00006":`Happy Birthday. The girls and I were having a
hell of a laugh. We were having a
good time. I had seviche finally! It was in
brilliant garlic but real chewy like tough
chicken gizzards. My fish was great - pout,
rolls, great strawberry cheese cake - Ruth
had fish too - we were having a laugh all
night. We had 3 glasses of wine & some beer, we
walked back. We had a good time - all the
way with us. We went through Piggalle & saw
some prostitutes & penguins etc. Re-saw Arc de
Triomphe & got out the Eiffel Tower. Then we
got home & a meteorite started. Ruth got
deathly ill - vomiting, diarrhea over night
& so weak & finally called a Dr. (or the
desk did) He was here in 20 minutes & was so
nice - gave Ruth a shot - 4 different
medicines to get next day. Dr. Phillippe de Mirey
It cost 350 francs or $70.00! But Ruth felt
better right away & finally fell asleep. It was 3:00
I was hungry - we took at lazy the next
day & got a breakfast. We had
180 francs or
about $40.00

Back to writing this.

69 tomorrow! Can't believe it! Anyway,
we are going to the Eiffel to eat & then on the
boat ride. So it will be a full day except
for tomorrow night.

This is the Louvre & the Latin
Quarter & Cluny museum. We are getting
sleepy & ready for bed. It's 9:50 & still
light.

Yesterday was a full wonderful
69 Birthday! We got pooped
anyway had my green top & tan slacks
on - we took metro and it was a puzzle!
Had to ask a lot of people but finally got to the
Eiffel on time. We had to walk a long way
down a lot of steps but it was beautiful -
fountains, statues etc. We got up at bed cute
little tables & decided to go for it and had
smoked salmon - very thin - I think raw and
not too good - but the house cocktail - pretty
sherry gin and dark cherries in it. Good. Had
hard rolls and salad. But Ruth got`,"1992__00008":`sick or faintly right in the middle so I had to get him to the toilet. I pay the bill. It was $5.00 for tea no dessert or coffee—oh well—that was about 50¢—oh well—we felt good enough to go on the boat down the Seine—that was wonderful—we had a wonderful lady guide that told us all about every building we along the way and under the 23 bridges! My biggest thrill came when I saw the grim building where they kept Marie Antoinette before they beheaded her—such history—it was overwhelming—I love it! After the boat ride which was an hour—(big about 200 people) we walked you a long way & had an easier time on the metro this time. We came back and I got a bottle of wine & some soup and instant coffee. We had supper the Sun Deck—I had a hamburger and French fries & coffee—without some TV & bed.

The Louvre—

Boy—we wore ourselves out but what fantastic things we saw! We walked a long way to the Louvre, waited in line—we were over 60 but paid $6.00 F. Worth every cent! We went upstairs on the escalator`,"1992__00009":"(though the Pyramid) and first and impressive thing we saw was the Winged Victory of Samothrace, about 11 A.D., dug up on the island of Samothrace. Then the Venus de Milo stood really close to her and Ruth took pictures. Then they really make you work to see the Mona Lisa. You go past great old Egyptian sarcophagi and up endless of stairs and down a grand spiral way with all these artists. There's in a glass case - Everyone is looking out no pictures. They super old look like they're looking right at you. After the Mona Lisa were stupid and weak (again) and find a nice little restaurant in the Pyramid. I had really good lasagna - mashed potatoes, milk, corn and cherry yogurt. We felt a lot better and walked to the exhibit of Monet, Picasso, Matisse, Modigliani, great Renoir's but the best was a large mural by Monet in 2 rooms of the water lilies - Simply and inspiring! We got pics started the long trek home. I found some neat T-shirts one for me - very Fiji-themed top, boy - later for Shawn. We met down by a","1992__00010":`Cute little old sidewalk cafe I had ice tea & coke—then got up and started the long arduous walk home! We got sort of lost and when we saw a cab we decided to take it home!—Thank goodness!—We got in our room and practically collapsed—had a little snooze at 6:00—at 7:00 we are going to a cute little place and eat if we can get in—and buy more T-shirts etc too. I have $8.00 francs left ($26.40 for my trip home) to Hard Rock cafe tomorrow then 9:15—

We had a great supper at the cutest one of the most expensive (outside of Eiffel tower) meals we've had yet—at the Darley Hippotones—cute little tables all crowded together—I had a rare steak—baked potatoes—bread—French beer—all very good—nice older lady & Ruth talked—then she left and a really cute couple sat down—we didn't think they would talk but they did—as nice spoke a little English—his girl was interested in San Francisco! It was so neat—got out and hurried home in the rain! Really coming down. To 10:00 & were going to bed.`,"1992__00011":`Friday - Well Ruth & I both had a terribly time getting to sleep! It was too hot and noisy - my head really hurt etc etc. Anyway we got up and took a hot bath then ate our "Continental breakfast" - Good! Up and ready to go out shopping.

We walked down darling little streets to the chocolate shop which wasn't open - Ruth went to get her French teacher some chocolate so we took a picture at the cute little Hippopotamus restaurant. It's raining again.

11:00 - going to Hard Rock -
3:15 - Had a great time - we are both getting on to the metro & found everything right off - just walked a few feet - we got darling shirts - got you one & me one - then a cute guitar pin for Janet a key chain for me that says Hard Rock. We had huge sandwiches - ended here shaved but took it home - also great french fries & 2 beers (Heineken) cute little ladies named Stephanie - took pics - there in stained glass! - looked in some shops but the place home. Sleepy today up.

Then came a great walk all the way to the St Chappell Church one of the oldest in France - this is all on an island`,"1992__00012":`The church was old - 11th or 12th century! Millions of pieces of stained glass making the entire story of the Bible! They took them out during WW2 - The court where all the big cases are tried was next door. The police rebelled against the Nazis & holed up for 4 days with a lot getting killed (208) until the American got here! We walked up a tiny spiral curving stair to the top church part where the Royalty worshipped - wondered how many cold hungry monks & priests walked by those in the centuries? Have you Chilled? Big round window was Christ's life. They said one monk came every day for 4 months & a flashlight to see all the characters and still didn't! Cost 31 francs to get in - we finally figured out our francs - more or less

leftover sandwiches - then walked back to shop & had ice cream in hotel -

It was a great old day - Our last
in Paris. We decided to go back to
Montmartre where we had our
last dinner. This time on the
metro. I'm glad we did because we saw
lots of wonderful real French people, old
ladies, waiters, pretty young girls and we
got lots of their pics. Ruth always asked
first - When we got there we took an
elevator to the top of the Sacred Heart
Church but got off too soon and walked
up winding steps (the famous
Damn steps) around 150 of them no kidding!
we were exhausted - then got to the veranda,
a little elevation in the side of the mountain
and lots more steps at the top! The place
was crammed but we
were in the church -
really beautiful - lots of people praying, I
bought a Candle for 15 francs & before for
Dorothy then took the Candle. She'll like that.
We came out and went to the Artists' Colony
section. Saw a funny little guy doing a
weird dance - mesh on his feet & backward
steps.

Did dance &
Conducted an orchestra.`,"1992__00014":`We got the money. The artists' colony was so crowded I didn't like it but we bought two tickets at key chains enough for friends. Anyway we had a good time. Bread cheese on long hard bread & a glass beer - "Be-Air" - Pette had omelette potatoes & "coca" we saw everything I decided we have jumped on came back on metro. Took baths & little nap and are getting ready for our nice big boat meal at the Hippopotamus Restaurant & having my room top block off rent.

I felt a little over dressed but had a great time. I really cute David and mother French boys that spoke English out next to us and we had a great talk with them. One drives a big boat down the Seine and asked me to go for a ride too! Then we couldn't go. He had a good picture of himself with Sly Stallone! We had a great meal - shish kebab of pork beef & lamb on a long metal skewer - lettuce & tomato salad jacked potatoes & rolls two "Kira" wine with fruit - and a great great dessert white frothy & caramel & sliced almonds.

Tue - June 2 -

The trip home was great up until we hit
Philadelphia. We had great food - drinks and
car - great movie "Little Boy Blue" - we had
a lot of laughs - but at Philly we had to
get our damn luggage again for
Customs - we saw Dorothy Bishop & her
hubby Eldon (for a brief few minutes)
then signed papers & declared no
contraband tax - 250$ worth - I had about
300$ - finally met them - felt like they
were total strangers! - Eldon bought me
drinks - (had a beer) then I kissed his
goodbye - my veteran's really started -
I hours to Pittsburg - only had a
Sprite - Pittsburg airport is run down
and dirty - my legs were tingling and I felt
lousy - I got a sandwich and coffee & magazines
but then went to the gate - felt so
odd! - felt like I was still moving - gotten
the plane - met by a really nice guy who
talked - then I got a magazine! - Damn - good`,"1992__00016":`they I—had a pill—just kept my eye closed for an hour.

I could hardly get up the airplane ramp but it was great to see darling Denis—Shala Ashley & Ryan, Shawn & Michelle were on their way back from Sioux City—Dona—don't know about Brian anyway I told them about Paris on the way back, and laughed a lot—felt better but still so pooped I went to bed & the kids left, I slept good and decided to go on to work—I took a hot bath coffee & feel better.

So that's my trip—Wonderful wasn't it?—

End of Trip!`,"2002b_00002":`Sept. 13 - 2002

Got up at 6:40 after a sort of tossy sleep night—but Tom slept in the bed all night—I am really upset & wondering about this no sex stuff—mean to have a talk about it—because if we don't do it this will never work—what is his problem?—Gorgeous morning out—Cool—guess I'll take Speed for a walk—He's got poop all over his butt—I couldn't get off—Well—Tom & I talked—He felt like he might be "taking advantage" of me after all this time away—HA!—I said "you know I've always liked it—might as well be sleeping with my brother"—So is that solved? Hope so—Everything else is great`,"2002b_00008":`Tue Sept 24th
It worked great!
Tom locked the door took off my clothes & had sex — it needs work but we will get there. The only problem now is my snoring!
Tom went to Honeymoon & had a great time while I napped. Huge waves knocked him over & took his raft & sun glasses! But he loved it. We met at Club & shot shuffleboard — he beat me first game 15 to 14 but I beat him second 15 to 0 — we played some cards & lost. He's off now to check free clinic & I'm going to get his chain & a new raft —
Also got him a darling "snuggle" stuffed bear — put his chain on it & cashed Mike's check for him some nice shoes — guess I love the guy!

Wed - Sept 25
Well not a bad day —
I moved Tom's blankets over
the bed around — hardly any room left. Ha-
anyway this noon we went to Kmart
and got Tom 2 pair of shoes — next dress`,"2002b_00009":`shoes & some athletic shoes - they were $30 & second pair 1/2 price but we got it for $15.01 - Got eye stuff too - Came home & mapped - Tom went to Honeymoon & had wild waves again!

Supper was great—then TV + bed—today was busy—we went to Clearwater Beach + had a great time—but Tom again lost his glasses in a big wave—I got knocked down sort of dragged along the sand on my butt + had 2 beers and sandwich—shower + dressed—then called at Stein Mart—Car wouldn't start?—so Mike wasn't here—Tom & I went up—wouldn't start—Tom doesn't think it's the battery—maybe alternator do they want to see—the may go to Tarpon Turtle—by boat—I had a long talk with Tom's old friend—she sounded nice + level headed—& told her I loved Tom—she said "we all do"—I said "no"`,"2002b_00011":`I mean I am in love with him" —
He told Tom about it (not
that sentence) — Mike's boat battery
was dead so we went way down
to Shells in Dunedin — Now the
bizarre part — at the very next
table was Johnny — Jo Rachel
& another old gal & a
guy I — I
didn't even look over — Tom kept
a couple of times — Sheila knocked over
full
pop — I know they had
& fish new pots & cole

Sat — Sept 28
Up at 7 — coffee prayer
Tom up at 8 — he wasn't
Church? Oh well — & called Charley

Eagles at 4 or so — not sure
about him though — just tried
(10:00) to call Brian on tons
card — no answer — will try`,"2002b_00012":`Later - I hope he isn't gone! Where is my Vicker check? - I can cash it at Cash & Carry.

When we got here made mad love — Ha-Had the house to ourselves — slept away & can't find my lower teeth! — WITS — 20 to 8 if everyone is asleep.

Don't know what to do now — it's almost 6 — lots has happened — we went to Honeymoon — I walked a lot — we ate a hot dog & had a coke — then went to see the Arts — Scottish Tower 11 — home there to talk to — will go up two — close home & then went looking for that damn golf course — never found it drove & drove & got pooped! Tom brought a Stolberg & drank — anyway finally came home & napped — Tom went to Honeymoon again — then got up & called Jim & Shawn.`,"2002b_00014":`Well I tried to learn the house rules down low—man—I put grease in a big skillet & was going to fry pork chops—Sheila said—put with my pots in the oven so I walked off—then I walked into the front room—smelled grease burning—a HUGE fire—good thing Mike was cool—got the extinguisher & put it out fast—there was smoke all over the house—we put fans facing out—OK now—waiting for supper—my neck feels better—

Monday—Sept 30
Last day of Sept & a terrible fire—last night like an idiot—I ate a big piece of Rich choc & then laid down flat—I got terrible bile etc but then started shaking & couldn't stop! But Sheila up—put lots of covers on me still shaking uncontrollably—I started rubbing my worst legs & finally just shaking—But Sheila went to see to`,"2002b_00015":`to ER in case of smoke inhalation
So poor old Tom took me up at 6-
Didn't get in for 2 hours - then
waited another hour - NVTB But
my lungs are OK - & they think its
flu or a bad cold - came home saw
Dana & Maria at convenience store - she
asked me where I was hiding Tom all
this time - but Dana looked awful - all
poorly white & thin - Home bed - none
left to job - apply - thinks he has a
chance (sleep until 1:30)
ate crackers - milk - 2 pieces toast -
Tom just felt for Horseshoe
good - He closed it - I called
Sheila to bring me medicine

Finally felt better this morning
Read - cleaned up - at 12:30 watched
Tom to the Beach - at 4 to the
Eagles - Tom beat me at Shuffleboard
& once at pool`,"2002b_00016":`Still feel kind of sick at my stomach—Diana came over—little chaos but fun—Sheila got kids cute little curtains eyes swirled noises—they loved them. George got Moody & Andrew kept wanting to "go home"—but it wasn't bad—Last week Maria had flu & Dana was sickish last night—my nose hurt a lot—today it's better.

Where is Vickers chick?—And Toms checks?—he has my car—church store I hope!—He needs to find a job—maybe we should go to the apt. today & look at it—we'll see—I still don't feel very good—let dressed up—where is Tom? 9:30—

3:00—well—a good & disappointing day—we applied—& gave him a $235 to ok!—pretty sure will get it. But the mail came—no Vickcheck & no union checks—for Tom—poor Guy—We are job hunting`,"2002b_00017":`tomorrow - I've got a check for $65 - so we cashed it - got out $20 out at the bank.

He got 4 beers - I got a bottle of wine. I had him go to Carversway & stuff. I really want Tom happy - & I will try to guess I'll go call John Trent.

**Thursday - Oct 3**

A gorgeous cool morning finally! It won't stay - my neck feels better - I hope - at 8 Tom went to the Y - then it's home & job hunt. I think just drive into Dunedin and apply in person at those places in the booklet. I got unhappy (again) with Tom - he flirts all day - talks about sex - sucks my toe - kisses the back of my neck & then says "Goodnight" no kiss or anything - it really pisses me off & I told him this morning. Also said he won't smoke in the apt. There is point store in Tampa with ad in - Best & think we'll go to jobs around first in`,"2002b_00018":`Quentin, — Allie is in the water — just floating down the river + still now.

A long letter from Corky—She loved my letter—Poor Corky—

Well—I'm in total shock!

Tom is gone!!—First the fight about Corky & phone cards—then I tipped him $5 for a card & extra $17.00—he went to "library"`,"2002b_00025":`while I napped—at 3:30 back—

when he came in I said "How stupid
can I be?"—you needed that card
so I didn't know you were calling
her—you just can't get over her
can you? & changed clothes &
stormed out—he said "you are

Friday Oct 11

Well—at 6:00 AM the phone rang—"Mary—this is Tom—just wondered if you want me back?" I said "NO—to much lying & spying & my nerves always shot"—He said "OK" & hung up—That is THAT!

Sheila bought a moose and table—$178.00!

7:00—Well—had fun—glad I left—went to Jesse's—sat outside—drafts $1.50 but next one free! So .75¢ a draft.

Jon called — told her all about moving & why — all about Tom and then my health.

went to bed at 8:30—Now—at 3 AM
and I can't sleep—I've almost decided
to not take this new medicine the

over the counter arthritis pills. Even
if Kitty sends them—something is
making me sort of dizzy & unsteady,
no one would ever know it—I may
just take my pill for Cholesterol—

So he threw me to downtown + I went into "boutique" — Nice older in pleated body suit — had nice talk — she wasn't owner but took my name & tel number & said she would probably need me. I also left some of the places I worked in. I found out about the NO money with Charley — Had a read out — just wasted it — with Tom just realized that $35.00`,"2002b_00049":`Check I wrote for Tomo apple wasn't in and those earrings not good for either.

NO MORE CHECKS or ATM

Wed - 2/16 11:20 - well picking up checkers might be a blessing in disguise - I got to talk to the lady at Savannah's and help her put stuff out.

Asked pharmacy about OTC medicine. Heard Tylenol extra pills really good. Think I'll just do I aspirin & some tylenol also my chol. pills.

I called Dr. about my pap test — he's calling at 4 — also called about new insurance rates — so I'm sticking by the phone — hope she calls about my job.

Dr. called. I get my ultra sound Mon at 9 — told him I couldn't afford those medicines. He mentioned placenta.

Friday - Oct 25

2 months until Christmas Jan! — One month & 1 week until I move! Boy, I hope this six days last more & I hope to get that job! It would give me`,"2002b_00052":`something to do after dinner! It's 8:00 - Mike still home - what's with him? - I hope he doesn't get fired & be here all next month!

The H.D. snipers were caught! 10 dead & 3 hurt. I took Speed for a walk - I think Ash is getting ready to go to work - Good - I may go to the library later.

I did go almost my last trip - as I'm getting ready to turn out of the rear window in an ass hole speeding - Changing almost started to go in them lane to go around me in the right hand lane - he had to brake & I'm already flinching for the Crash - the air was blue - he wouldn't look at me - MAN ate lunch - back hurts - took a Darvocet - got 4 good looking murder mysteries - Almost 12 - don't know if I'll stay awake until 9:30 - will sleep if not awake - Mike still`,"2002b_00053":`sick — It's hot out there again.

Big News — I was napping when Mike said "Mary do you want to see that big alligator? He's sitting in the back yard by the clock — I jumped up & came out — My God! He's huge & up in the yard! So I told Mike to take its picture & he did. Then Dudley went to the door & looked out — the alligator reared up turned around & ran to the water. Jumped in! My God it was spooky!! I may call Jan tonight & tell her about it.

I thought I might go to the Club but I'm kind of sick at the stomach — I'll see —

7:35 — Had a good time at Eagles except that stupid Bobby had me...`,"2002b_00054":`shoot shuffleboard (beat me) and
he's so Corny and Clumb—
Then tried to just practice at
pool—here he came—I beat
him but I think he let me.
I did talk to Michael—guy I
thought was cute—well—Im pretty
sure he is GAY—his roommates
name is Tommy & then I was
talking about Ashley & he said
"Whatever—I don't have any kids
don't talk about them." He—so—
but he is still charming & funny.
Then "Bobby" and I
played shuffleboard & won a drink—
home at 6:30—kids gone—I fixed
fish & dessert—
Watching a good "Sherlock
Holmes" as a young drug quote—
never last until 10 though.
Sat—Oct 26 Slept until 7:00! Those
new pills are great. Forget &
watched a movie—it's 8 now—I read
the paper—not sure what to do`,"2002b_00055":`today — may play in the shuffleboard tournament? I'll see — this room is AWFUL so I'll clean — I hope our big alligator never comes back — think I'll go to the Causeway trend — its 10:30

My car stinks!
Always about the time I go down Klosterman to Alt 9. It jerks jolts + jumps like crazy, does mins. Installed scares me to death — just read so neat, form there. Come home ate cheese + salad + orange slices — "Lost World" (new & hope) Coming on — no — it's old one — NUTS! just saw it Thur or Fri — Had a 2 hr nap — But am pickish — damn lettuce salad — Sheila just called — anything we wanted to eat? I got a soup — wrapped I guess, watching an Adventlobe Inc. that is a pretty good show —`,"2002b_00056":`modern day adventures - Sheila got some really good soup & sandwiches from a "Bread Company" - Big new show about Nostradamus? - Is he a hoop I think so?

8:00 - watching an early "Friends" - She got hanging flowers to put in a bird bath for in front -

Sunday - Oct 27 - Up at 5 but really 6 - clocks already half turned back - daylight saving - I think Sheila & might go out garage saleing - we better go early - I might find a coffee table

It's 2:30 - We had fun & got a neat lamp with a pale green shade - a really pretty clock with gold & turquoise paint & a cute pelican door knocker or knick-knack - took a nap - short on watching a kind of goofy kids show with a mummy that can walk & talk - ate some snacks - took Speed for a walk - not sure what to do next if the`,"2002b_00057":`day — I wish Mike would come home from fishing and drive my car for me & wonder what Charley is doing? — Could call — he just called me — working on his car. I asked him up to play "Upward" but he said it wouldn't be today. I bet he is going to Olga — HA — show is over now — guess I'll go read on the back porch —

Now I'm watching this amazing movie that could be about Tom — only this guy cons women and murders them — a smooth talking liar that charms people — takes their money — sets fires etc., etc., gets insurance money etc., etc., now the guy is telling him he is broke and everyone knows it — he even uses his tongue a lot like Tom was always`,"2002b_00058":`using his tongue. To stop around in his mouth. I don't know he is really an insane person on the edge of total insanity. I am so lucky he left when he did before screwing me up totally. Sheila is fixing salmon baked potatoes. I hate to see this end. This is how crazy people act. She goes to prison for 25 years.

Sheila made a great meal—baked sweet potatoes—eggplant & great baked salmon & also a banana nut cake—a good Sherlock Holmes—The Whitechapel Vampire—then at 8 "Hero Wolf" Hope it's new—otherwise $10 read—Another weekend gone

GOOD—Tomorrow at 9

Monday Oct 23

Well—last night I saw a shocking thing, Ashley`,"2002b_00059":`photographing herself topless on the computer! — I debated telling Sheila but finally wrote a note and left it in her car. Now for the blow-up? —

Well, it's 6:10 and I think Sheila is gone. — I hope she doesn't just ignore this deal like she does everything else —

8:15 — I decided not to leave until 9 — so that traffic will be quieter. They'll keep me outside 1/2 hour anyway probably.

Ashley is up — must have to go to work at 9th who cares? — I hope my car works O.K.

Poor Speed had a terribly asthma attack this morn. Ash actually got up & calmed him down — I rubbed his throat tummy — seems OK now. I need to take a shower in kids bathroom.`,"2002b_00060":`Back from Dr. Car acted terrible going up - backfiring jerking but fine coming home - pretty sure it is the oil I used - I think I'll get an oil change -
Dr. washed out my ear - room going around a lot - then he gave me Bo aggrox to last until the results of my ultra sound in. They have to get O.K. from my ins. company - probably won't get it - they did get it.
Slept until 2:15 - after 4:30 A.M. -
Ashley just came in - I'm heading for Eagles soon - not sure how Sheila is going to react to that note. Probably hear it up and just forget it like she does everything else - Can't find the number to Eagles Club -
Well went up there - pissed off those guys wouldn't let me short shuffleboard - "I need a partner" Ha - anyway - practiced pool - BAP had 5 beers - went`,"2002b_00061":`To Snoppers - Ordered a Reuben.

Up at 6 - Mike still here but left at 7 - then back at 8 - in bed & guess now - what is going on? Wake up? That drives me nuts around here - no one says anything - Didn't see Sheila at all last night, or this morning - what about Ashley? I need to cash my check & pick up that one at Apts.

I also need to buy at least 2 cans of oil: 10-30 — at a dollar store — down by Cpts.

Worse day I've had for ages! Decided to try & pick up that check — Car scared hell out of me — never again except maybe to Snappers.

I knew I'd get that job. So it's 4:05 now where is Charley? God I need my car! Mike thinks it is the gas fuel cover - Hope so - that's only $20 - Come on Charley! It is the spark plugs and some wiring that oil was dropping on Charley had used the wrong glue on the head gasket - anyway he drove it home & left his car for me to drive`,"2002b_00064":`down and meet him.

apt—what would we do until

home—slept—Charley called—
he'll be done in an hour or so—
I may go on to shop?

Charley called—11—on the
way up—bill is $70—could
have been worse—so I think I can
still have $600 in the bank next
month—

Got the Job!

Roy is exactly what I thought`,"2002b_00065":`Skinny - nervous - smokes - black outfit - hadn't even looked at my list of previous jobs.

upstate said "where is gentleman?" I
said "Visiting his daughter in So. Carolina"
she said "why are you parking in my
place?" I said "I didn't know
we had places" she is holding her
left boot? "oh we don't he always
park over there so he can see his
car." I tried her & moved to that I
needed to be by the door - I had a
balance problem in walking - she left.
nutty! - guess all paint - been a good
day.

Almost 9 - hope the day goes fast.

Got lots done - ordered cable by getting $35 month package its free installation - then later I can go down to $25 if I want to. Also found out I can keep Dr. Duran - so I think everything`,"2002b_00112":`but packing is done - Can't wait.

Just back from Jesse - met at Johnnie - calling over Steve - a boring quiet little guy that I felt sorry for + bought a drink. I asked her not to get him over there so (she was drunk) I bought him a drink + he came over. She gives him the 3rd degree + she then leaves. So of course now whenever I'm there help come over - I called her + said "Well thanks for training Jesse for me - now help be over no matter who I am with - and I know you talk to people about themselves". She was giving him the 3rd degree - then left - so I called her + said "Thanks for training Jesse for me - now help be there all the time - with you - with Charity - with you - everybody" - she said I didn't think you really didn't want him here - so I just said "Oh I'll talk to you later" - now I have the phone off - when she gets drunk she just thinks she is so`,"2003__00003":`Cute - I may give Steve her phone number & ask her for a date.

I said "Let's just give it a few days & please don't get around me if you've been drinking wine - Let's just cool it a couple of days" - She said "All right you know you've done things that upset me when you were drunk" & said "Like what?" - She couldn't think of one - Nuts - I need my V mail machine! Guess I'll call Sheila - if she knows...`,"2003__00005":"not a good day! Went down to swim - pool closed for repairs.

Sit next to her - talks - then we move over to eat at the table. I think he said he had more fun in there in a long time. So now she's got a boyfriend. I suggest to her we go to Jesus - but she mentions it to Steve - when he got up I said I wasn't just no - like hitting her with a hammer - so later I said I was just going home & she did too - so he left & we went to Jesus they loved our hats - one beer & left - me too but I went back to Club. Oh yes - I won the hat contest! - Judy`,"2003__00065":`said it looked "spring-ier" 10¢ tab-

Then met a fun goodlooking (one

gabbing & shot pool. I beat him 2
games & he beat me one. Got to
talking about sex (pool does that)
he told me he was crazy about a
married gal (supposedly in an abusive
marriage) or he'd go home with me &
give me an orgasm like I've never had
before - Ha! - name is "Gary". He
put in 20¢ for the kids fund. He's
an electorion & ate more than finally
went home. Called Sheila - kids out

Nice full day & eve.

Std 2:25 just had a good nap.
Laid down at 12 - slept until 2 - woke up
and decided my hair needed cutting so
called "Hair Hunter" across the street -
only 12 $ for a plain cut - 30$ for
shampoo & blow dry - no way -
Decided also to just drink Wed.
Fri & Sun - Sun by myself - maybe a
new place - or lie to Johnnie & go
to Club alone - I'll figure it out.
Watching YKR - then go swim - TV
dinner - 7:20 watching a cute`,"2003__00067":`old friends" - now "Hollywood Square."
I bought some perfume & it really
squeezes in my ear.

Tue - April 22
Up at 5:30 - a nightmare
about our family trying to eat together.
Mom & Dad were there too (P.S. talking
about them) and I got completely lost in
some ruins somewhere. Hate "lost dreams."
Today I need some groc. Need to
answer Ruth's new long e-mail. Enid
& his deafness is driving her nuts.
He can at least get out of the house &
get groc etc. So glad I'm NOT
married -
Wrote P. & it just sent itself-
But

BIG NEWS -
Brian flying to Bangkok & then
HOME - I e-mailed to please
fly to Tampa & at least stay
until June - He isn't sending`,"2003__00068":`Johnnie anymore e-mails. Good—our friendship is really cooling down.

I have to get my car fixed—muffler tail pipe. Not sure about the house—maybe I'll buy a separate house—Ha—

See—I'd love to have Brian here! Maybe he could get the kids canoe—do they still have it?—Also he can have one of the kids bikes—I'm going to take one of my chairs to the back yard—he could read out there.

Went to store—bread—milk—cat food—litter—cheese $8—boy the money goes—my bank bal said $109.

Then probably $7 out for bank charges—$87—$50—$37

Have to get the muffler fixed—$37

Well Sad News—I think Brian is flying straight to`,"2003__00069":`Omaha to get a job - NUTS!
Maybe I'll fly up there in July?
We'll see - 11:30 - getting sleepy already... I may go to bed tonight.
Skip Wed - feel down about Brian.
Nice nap. Florence stopped by and gave me her tel No. Talked about Charlie - that won't work at all. He wants every second of everyone's attention on him, makes him so mad when she watched TV instead of talking to him! So needy! Watching YAK - then The Club.
7:30 - just had a lot of fun at Club - Jim there - first Jerry bought me a beer - then used my last ticket - Jim & finally shot pool - I beat them 2 AGAIN - then a really neat older guy named Scott played me - beat but barely - He is a good looking funny older guy - I asked Jennifer to find out if he is single. Worked like to mess around. Ha - Jim starts his quota.`,"2003__00070":`language - that darling little old lady come in - he is so sweet & smart. I got $40 out of ATM - going DOWN -

So walked to Jesse—had 2 beers—real long talk about Florence's boy friends life Charley not on her level—bad dresser—rotten temper etc., too fat—but if he called again—etc. She also let slip that she asked a guy if he wanted her phone number—before she told me he","2003__00072":`Asked her—Ha—not sure about her and her need for a boy friend—I told her I was going to the Club for a visit she said she could go to—oh man—another "Steve"—he was there but didn't come over—good—maybe I told him not to—I fixed tea & ham & cookies.

Thursday—April 24

Well—after I got home Florence said my phone had been busy all day—Came the nightmare—NO phone & no e-mail!—I messed around with all my phones—no go—and then the Vtech said buy new battery or plug in—I may see if Eckerd or Walgreens have batteries—Anyway went to bed but at 3 got up to fiddle with phone again—still no go—took a Valium & was sound asleep when Charles voice said "Mary get up—what's with your phone?" He was sitting in bed & hadn't locked the door—Anyway we started looking around with the phones—I called Tel Co. Told me to simplify them all & start over—so we did—`,"2003__00073":`got a dial tone & I could call out
and hear Ch. but he couldn't
hear me — as a last resort put
that white cordless in bedroom (it was
plugged in all night) and it WORKS
so — I can call people today. I
tell them no e mail machine until
Car is fixed. Ch. said he'd pay for
it let, and I could pay him back. He
is a good friend, good guy. AND
through with Florence I BACK
with Olga! — I just put my
head down and started laughing.
I guess her daughter took her
down there — I told him if he was
smart he would tell her he came
up this morn. to fix my phone.
Now— what a tangle — at Jesse-
me — Charley — Johnny — Steve — Florence
who sits with whom? I may
just go to Club 7 am tomorrow
night at 7. Talked to Ruthie — then called`,"2003__00074":`Johanna — on line to go Rachel —
said I'd call her back — went to
Sheriff's — got eye glass case — Eckards
to see about a battery — no go —

answering service —

Called Radio
Shack — they said bring everything in,
I will when I get a car or more
money. If Brian calls I might
walk over to Club later — short pool —

Called Johanna (she's getting a massage this
att.) Also called Florence — told her
Charlie was up helping me with my
phones — (rather cool voice) oh yes — but
didn't ask about him. Still trying to decide
if to tell her his luck with Alga.

Soap Opera! —

Oh man — It's 10 after 7 — what a
day — Charlie & I went to dinner at 1:30
took awhile — $110.00! not so? — anyway
we went to Club — didn't see them long
when Florence came in — sat next to
Charlie — I talked to Jerry — about`,"2003__00075":`Cleaning up etc. Then Florence said "Mary - we made up" - Eeeek - I said I can't handle it - since I know everything - looking at Charley I mean. Olga - Anyhow I said I'm getting out - home or Jesus - just don't follow me - I got up & went to Jesus - here's Steve - of course he came over - talked a lot - he is really a sweet but boring guy. Defo $15.00 - nuts - thing I bought didn't fit! I'll have to go out in the A.M. and take it back.

Just called Denis - he said Brian is NOT there - will call & let me know when he hears. When Charly & I came in, Doris said Johnny just left - (?) In sick of it all.

Friday - April 25 Up at 4 - thinking about money. WITS - and that damn Florence and Charly deal. I'm not going to listen to one word from`,"2003__00076":`either of them about each other. I will tell it. I went through Picky—Christa—me—Olga now her. NO WAY—Decided not to go to Karaoke but tell Flo. I'm not—

I really like Jerry and we have lots of laughs—He said "Mary you scare me I'm beginning to understand your humor"—Ha!—I'm going to dodge everyone and NOT call Johnny—or go to Jesus at 5 & Club—at 6

At 10:15 going to get my cord of new hookup for e-mail—Hooray found an extension cord in with my Xmas tree lights—watching CSI & "Without a Trace"—Really good shows

Almost 9—Great—I'm going to the Cheap store—or not—need to get do out—may go down CRT or Bay store—

Almost 11—Went to mall—had to wait—got do out—it said I only had $68—?

3:15—well—a good productive afternoon—laid down at 1/2—up at 2—went swimming—here came Florence—all smiles—they are going to hear me sing tonight—more & thought about it the Banger—called Flo & met over—I started out "Did you wonder why I left the other day so abruptly?"—Because I listened to you bitch about Charley all day and then him bitch about you and then you smile over & say "We're back together"—Do you know how many years she heard Charley break up—get together etc etc for 7 years—first his wife Pinky—then for 3 others—then me—then Olga—now you are tried to say "well I listened to them too" for 7 years?`,"2003__00078":`How about you? Johnnie—“We’re all right” (we aren’t) and then I said and I won’t sit with you I love birds—she said “I just didn’t want to you to be left out”—I said “I’m never left out” of anything. She said “O.K. O.K.” see you later. I’m not sure—I don’t feel very good. It’s raining looking out. Maybe I’ll still go. Several people went to hear me sing—Before it shows up Florence. I saw Charley heading for FL at 4:30. They better have been going to dinner—H.

Povesh just called—Bran in Omaha on fire—Told him about Russell & the post card—Nothing him like crazy gun did! I still don’t think he’s really looked mostly out

So glad I didn’t go—lightning thunder & more rain—I saw Charley & Florence walk to the elevator to go—The lightning is wild! I should say yes & suppose—& need to decide what to`,"2003__00079":`So about who I run around with... (or just myself at Club - 3 to 4 - 4 to 6)

Then a long one from R. Asking if my liver wasn't enlarged once - about Aunt Lillian dying before Homer when he drank a lot. Sometimes she is very negative. Also about quitting my "pills" - diet.

Took out in back & then at 4:15 to pool—Boy they love that pool—This time taking turns seeing who could hold their breath the longest. For some odd reason Judi (in wheelchair) came over and started telling them how to do it. Then she just leaves without saying "Goodbye"—odd gal—guess I would be too if I was in a wheelchair 12 years—They loved it but at 5:35 came up & dressed & ate—ham & potato tots—ice tea & milk—then back to the pier & beach—they had a ball digging for little crabs—George got a bigger one that punched him—Ha—He threw it up in the air—came up here and tried to play "Upward" He ended up building them up into towers.

Called Ruthie we had good laugh over it.`,"2003__00088":`I feel like a weight is off my back. Also I guess since probably Florence is pissed I'm fed up everyone but Steve. Maybe I'll start going to Dolphin Inn—not sure how much their beer is but I love it up there.

Took a nap—watching TV—sooner or later I've got to go get bread and cat food. My knee is swollen up & hurts—also cloudy out. You're getting better.

Had fun - at 4:30 went to Jesse - Head - Olive then 9:30 because my new ATM card wouldn't work - went to Club - Jerry in - Stacy in there - good talk - back to Mary & Marianne - Jerry doesn't throw up yet to talk about Mary - the trouble maker - wrote 10$ check.

Tue - May 6th

Well - up at 4:30 - thinking about money - ha - got my elec 38$ - only sent 25$ - Today I have to activate the new card & take Jesse 3.00 for yesterday - just called the bank - just put in an inquiry about balance - how my stupid mail won't send 2 letters I wrote to Ruth & Jan! - Write`,"2003__00100":`Just made a disturbing discovery. The e-mail plug I had plugged in the "kitchen" overhead, and it was only one when the kitchen light was on! So it was using batteries all the other times - so the switch has to be on (up) all the time. I'll call kids today. Ruth & Jan & also need to change my tel number in my profile. It has been so humid but getting a little better.

Well - my stupid remote won't work! - tried diff batteries - don't want to buy a new one - & have to get up & change - I want to watch YVR not have the TV in working. I need a damn new remote control - had a 2 hour nap watching YVR - then the bank pay fees - take Andy in then come back & swim at 4.

Did all that - had one beer at Club - water was great at`,"2003__00101":`Slept good

Wed - May 17 Up at 6:00 - paper

my Pelican poem - will see if
they want to put it in a "Tenants
Corner" in our paper -

At 9:15 will call Eckerd

Cat really good at fetch -
Paid $2 for remote - can't get
it to work - but found out VCR

Couldn't get it to work - tried everything -
May go get some shorts at

one pair - my silk white checks - YAR

I don't feel very
good - not sure ice tea`,"2003__00102":`agrees with me anymore. Ate some crackers.

Quite an afternoon—Got my money back for that remote—went to Club—Had a horrible shock! My darling little Al Field Sun. The cute intelligent funny man I just loved! Jennifer told me—I started crying and went to the bathroom. It hit everyone—Doris was getting drunk—I can easily see a nasty side to her. Anyway—a guy named Don Hatley asked me to shoot pool. I beat him—everyone said "you beat Don?" Well—talked to Mary a lot (getting her on my good side she does have a cute dog) Later this Don wanted to shoot again—we were 2 to 8 ball & he scratched! He bought me 2 drinks—took a ticket for next time & go in. The same trampy gal down at the end of the bar "Uncle" boy she is so cheap always drunk & trying to pick up`,"2003__00103":`Ruthie just called.

Thur - May 8

Up at 5:30 - another lost nightmare - supposed to meet Ruth at a Dept. Store - lost in another factory - man - my drinking nightmare just had an odd thing happen. I screwed in my little bulb in the kitchen - no go - the switch on the wall was off - which means my e-mail wasn't getting juice all night. So I put it on screwed in the bulb & a minute later it clicked itself off! Now I either have to leave light on or check switch all the time or move eft. cord down for the cat to get - NOIS -

not sure about taking R to Club - lots of that "F" word & that tramp - maybe just go in I look around, I will say something to Jerry about it. No one else said anything but I said "Oh no - I hate that word!"`,"2003__00104":`It's 8:30 - need a few groc. may walk down - store across to dollar store - get cat food & letter stamps (4 at Hallmark) (cat food at Publix - looked for maps of China - find one of Iraq - need to go to Mall I guess -)

Trying to decide whether to be mean & take Steve to Sunday brunch at Club since J. asked him. Maybe go at 10?

Watching "Weakest Link" - greatly stupid black family of brothers & sisters.

It's 10: - $2,250 all together.

Muffin having fun with a plastic bag.

6:50 - went to Jesse's - of course, Steve there - showed him interesting letters - very

Called Ready to go downstairs—Florence & she decided to go—Don't know if to ask about Charley?`,"2003__00106":`Well—That's it Florence! She didn't show up—Some really nice older gal sat down & she knew Flo. Said she had told her all about Charley—
I'll bet they are—if—Well—no one stands me up—I even bought her back a vial—knocked on her closed door—no answer—left the vial—wrote to you Flo—
I told R. I wanted to get rid of a lot of hangover—& jocks and she done it—No Johnny—no Florence—where's Charley?
I saw little Sue at the Art Club—told her I'd be down this Wed. to play Bingo. After that I'm going to swim—
Had a great swim—Warren & one other guy—"Big Boobs" but she sat in the sun talking to a girl friend—Good—Anyway watching Pyramid—

Thinking about this Bill & I doing a "gig" at Jesus upstairs—Cole Porter and Gershwin in Key West—I do know that manager there. Called Ruth & told her about it. Blonde wig formal?

I'm really pissed at Charly—not calling or going down anymore. Stacy said they were in last week "smooching"—tickles me they didn't come in last night—saw my car probably, next week I'll walk over—Ha—

I got a damn notice from the library in Palm Harbor—I supposed to have 2 damn books still—I took them to Dun. library after I moved—Need to go up—or call—and I'd owe for 2-1/8.95 books—NUTS—

So when Steve & I came in, Flo & Johnnie in there. So they both came down & I said brightly "Hello gals" — she whispered to Flo & Johnnie, "Steve is here!" Seriously? HA—Anyway, I really shot good pool again. Anyway kind of interesting for tomorrow.

Then May 22

Couldn't sleep — woke at 2:30 & up at 4:30 — money & Alan & guess. Decided to go to Kash & carry with pennies. Get gas in car with it. Had a nice long e-mail from R. & wrote a lovely one back — told her about J & Steve — pool etc. & think I'll go back to bed.

8 — tried to sleep — NO go — took my pennies up to Kash.`,"2003__00137":`and carry $5.00 - got gas - I have
1/2 tank but will watch it
anyway - walk to Club etc. On
way in - waved at Florence - said
"where you going?" - forgetting she
hates that - She said very
coolly - "just out" - I laughed
and "Oh secretive to the end"
what a screw ball - who cares -
she probably is mad because Step
didn't fuss over her - And I
wonder if she really has a
car? - Kitty likes to put
little objects in my shoes -
in his water bowl - lids &
candy & pen tops - what a nut!
Washed dishes & some tops
of mine - Haven't cleaned for R,
but will have all day the 28th
Finally napped - It's 1:30 - I
called - Dolphin Delight - don't need
preservation good`,"2003__00138":`Well—a whole new ball game!

Big storm outside — wind & rain & I should sleep good tonite — no worries

Oh yes — Mary Anne asked if I was still interested in that job of being "Companion" to home person — 3 hr day — 3 days a week

8x9 72 wks — oh yes — 72/4 $288 mo.

Friday May 23 8:00 — Made a big decision this morn. No love affair! If only Alan wasn't married — but I guess I have developed a conscience in my old age — I'll call him and tell him this morn. — Sort of a load off my mind anyway.

Clothes etc etc wrote R. about it & got an e-mail from Brian in`,"2003__00140":`Omaha—thanks help go out Sunday again. I told him to send me a card—well—good for me—win a medal on me. It was short & sweet.

Alan—many—I just can't do it—I thought I could last night—with the beer & all—but if you just weren't married

He gave a very brief "no problem" said "we'll still shoot pool." He said Absolutely—Maybe he is relieved too.

Going to store—need milk & to juice next—corn—

got stuff—watching W. Link—a dumb blok girl just cost them $25,000 but is still there—what a game—making Creamed eggs on toast for lunch—1:20—had a long nap—11:30 to 1:15—Don't feel good—I'll watch you when it comes on—watched it—Jain—Got a cute card "Thanks for being my friend"—(not birthday) had a 30 year old letter I wrote to Robin—saying to "love your mother more" etc. Don't remember it at all.`,"2003__00141":`ate hot spinach & rice - watched TV & then had a swim.

about Ruth's visit etc., now I am meeting
Mary Anne at Club to see about where to
ask Lynn to meet me. I'll tell Brian
to call there.

Forgot to say first I stopped
at Charlese - we had a nice talk -

went out & ate at Cricketers - she
wanted to go to his place but just
got in the door she said
she was sick - "take me home" - She told
him she thought she was going crazy -
also she didn't really want to run
around with Johnny - Ha - I called
him too - trying to tell him
how to
run his life. She said he told her
years ago not to try & run his life.
No wonder she is desperate - no`,"2003__00154":`friends! - go Rachel in Germany -

12:45 - Adam - Brian called again when I was out & left a number for me to call but I didn't get it! So I'm going to read my new book - may hope he calls.

He didn't, but I mapped it at 3:08 finally decided to try his old cell phone - he said "I'll call you in 10 minutes" - an old "Relic Hunter" is on. Glad he is calling - I'm going down in back and read & then sworn at 5 - so glad I decided to try it -

Just had a great 20 min talk with Brian - he said Molly is really a spoiled brat - wrecked a car & they bought her another one - also Brian said they all went out to eat & Phyllis threw another fit about being charged for a 10 oz steak & it was only 8 oz - what a bitch, I remember her doing that in Omaha about a dream that wasn't mixed right - made them take it`,"2003__00155":`back & re-do it, - Bi. said he'd never eat with her again, - I hope I don't have to see them - and maybe Molly, some - should be interesting. I won't have much money after paying that damn bank overdraft. Never again!

I had a good swim - a couple Larry and ____ joined me. Then I saw Judi, Georgia Paul & Peggy going to the Club - kind of funny - never asked me or told me - Don't care - I'm becoming a "lover" - Great breeze coming in.

Wed May 4 - Up at 5 - feel pretty good - A good 8 hours sleep. Looking forward to seeing Lynn today at Cricks - Club Soda & no game.

Just got home from Wal-Mart - a huge`,"2005__00033":`rain storm coming home - get ready, leaf for end cat litter my pail (for a month) and store filler if a flat. So I did good - also cut story (he didn't play with) all I napped - bed nap - kept hearing - I just in new message and found out how to get phone messages.

Back from Crocks - pretty dull - good old Lynn gave me early birthday present - really pretty sparkly earrings + 2 gecko pins also a darling card - goofy cat on it. I have to say it was really boring.

Hawika Lynn, me & Paul

just was so quiet - only seeing one there was John - our "gory" bartender - he is a scream - I had 3 club sodas - he doesn't charge so I left him a $1 tip. Came home at 4:30 - made fish, baked potato + broccoli + cheese + ice cream -

7:40 AM Thu May 5 Slept until 5:40! I have to do a wash today - sheets too. Also got pics and send R's package. The week my name are zooming by but the days pretty long just had a terrible migraine lasted an hour! Called Dr. of course got worse ever - message - she won't even call back. Self call at 4 - I did go to Wal Mart - got pizza really good - had to cut down to send to R. Almost 12" after my mail R's package - I should get those papers from insurance people.

Watching TV then nap. Cherry Dr. actually called - getting a cat scan will call let me know when Dr. on Mon 3/45

Just had a nice call from Shawn-Michelle & Glenda were out "having a drink"—she only calls when she's gone—didn't bother me!—the boys tell her—Callin played one cute jazz piece "My Babe Done Buggsy" and one God awful classic "Butchered Bach." He—he got totally lost halfway through it. But wait anyway—and had a good talk with Connor—he said when Callin goes to his lessons on Mondays he goes to his other grandma and she feeds him ice cream and stuff—uh—I asked him if Daddy still smokes? U-h-h-h—& said you go tell him grandma said you stop that smoking—Daddy?" I said "Well get mad"—I said "That's OK—I'm his mom—I can say that!"—and said Goodbye—Watching TV—an old Friends.

Friday May 6—up at 5:15—took a good shower—(should every morning) So far I feel good today—do a wash—mom Paul told me they were sending me mail—haven't gotten it yet—she wish I'd get that money—OF COURSE—Don't Talked to Ruthie—then went to Wal-Mart—got little frostings for necklace.`,"2005__00037":`For paper - I was going to get gas but pump was full.

Watching "Price" - boring day! - ate ham & chili mac at glass house - no me - no call from Dr. Esther -

736-2513

May 12 - 11:00

I went for mail (more) & asked Marcy to come look at my necklaces - she said she thought they were pretty & took a frosted pale green one - she also told me there is a cute "Bead" store up on Temple & CR I & fixed about 6 pairs in a long plastic box & took up - felt stupid first minute in boxes of tiny crystal beads - they were all .20 or .30 each!

And some big ones for

2 or 3 each - I felt goofy - but showed her anyway - she said maybe some "show" or street commercials - Povesh - I left - got gas - got bottle wine & came home - told Ruthie about`,"2005__00038":`it - she said eye Dr. said if she'd like to wait her eyes were really OK. - Doubt if she does do it.
ate pot pie & cottage cheese. - a funny 70's show - Stevens' 18th birthday - I don't have any energy.

Sat - May 7
Slept long last night & up at 4:50 - nuts - those bead continue to haunt me - what to do with them? Taped a "Miss Marple" Unfortunately - I'd seen it taped before and with a much better cast and better Miss Marple - I just vaguely remember it.
Stirred on my lap - moving her paws up & down & drooling.

7:45 - I stumbled onto a funny movie "A Life Less Ordinary" - Cameron Diaz & Evan M. Gregor - about a botched gay kidnap deal - really funny - not good of ending - in heaven I think -
1:30 nice nap - made some chopped beef on toast

Undoubtedly the most boring worst day ever - and I bought yarn (expensive angora) - then at 2:30 - Cricks Egg - little Don + awful "Climb" - had club soda - then stumbled to Commodore Mary Anne - lil Steve (his birthday) stinking worse than ever - another new lady + her hubby - It was`,"2005__00039":`AWFUL! - Also think Mercy (the bartender) is a bit braggy. She said she sent her sister & friends to a concert in a limo - got free tickets for $1500 - also her wedding is in 3 weeks & I think she's a bit hard. Also Mary Anne pissed me off - just changed subject when I was talking about my head etc., and when I said But next door was gay she said And smelly? I don't care what he is" & snapped back at her & she calmed down. Coming back through Cricks was a low point - Doc + Gas Station + playing game (had to stop me + talk may have to go back & met until after cat scan. I was so desperate & stopped & bought 2 "scandal" rps + 2 gambling tickets - won one free ticket - HA - drank a glass of wine - & got the most wonderful card from Shawn - very sentimental. Atending me + telling me he loves me - & cried & probably will when I thank him. Writing so Michelle will be gone.`,"2005__00040":`Sunday - Mother's Day - May 8

Well, what's in store? I know Sheila will do something. Got up at 4:50 - 6:00 now - no paper until 7 - if then - I picked out necklaces for Tommy, Andrew & George - tiger & leopard beads and blue for Maria - a green one with a leaf on the end for Sheila - don't care if they wear them or not.

So that's $170 all together - I had fun at lunch - the place is really cute - all reggae style - food`,"2005__00041":`super! I had seafood salad bouquet - the best cole slaw! - Could only eat half - Came home napped - then to Wal-Mart - a really neat blouse - ten stitches - some obsession & a little card for my cell phone - I will carry in the car with me. I got home & Mike had called. Called him back & they are gone - Ha - Be glad when its bed time.

Nice talk with Mike & Mary. Getting close to return - sell their house & buy a big mobile travel home. Mary said sending my birthday money.

Monday - May 9 Up at 5:30 - watching "Desperate Housewives" - a kill! "Had a neat surprise yet, Dona Maria and Rida came in I had a cute knick knack of two cats looking at a bird in a cage. And some roses in a bouquet plus a nice card for "Grandmother". They were really sweet - I gave Maria & Dana a necklace & told little boys there was up at Sheilas - they really liked them. Good - also sending Mary & Jan some. I have to try & take that tel Card back & exchange it. Hate to & try`,"2005__00042":`May not do it. Oh well— I was thinking about joining a spa— so much a month— decided to wait until after my cat scan.

Boy did I luck out!— they just gave me money back on card!— then I got another one. I'll put it in. I mailed Jan & Mary's checks. Got some orange, star, banana juice— really good— I'm already hungry— 10:00!

6:10 PM— Quite a day!— After nap went to thrift store— clothes ½ off— found 2 pairs of white + linen blend off white— $2.00 each— Ha— may get the linen ones cleaned— then Dr. Adorable as ever— took a blood sample— gave me 2 nitroglycerin— said cut in half— just take when you have a migraine— he called them "visual migraines"— I said "Do I have 2 months?" He laughed + said "If you only had 2 more months, it would jump out at me and be pretty evident." Ha!

While I was sitting there my cell phone rang— an old message from Shawn— some Thursday when I wasn't there— So I shut it off— It's for me to use on the road— in an emergency—`,"2005__00043":`Tue - May 10

Slept until 6:15 - super watching a funny last 3 Raymond - Raymond is smoking because Amy's mother did. Really cute! Now a pretty funny 2 1/2 men - Hate the laugh track though - I have lots of gas for some reason. Diarrhea!

Went to W. mart - got kitty litter nail polish & playing pills - came home & made Ashley & Leon necklaces - ate lunch veggie wine - beef chick sandwich + cheese - pretty good - watching "Price Is Right" - Amy just lost a hair car

Wednesday May 11

Mtn - went to bed at 7:45 a record - and of course up at 4:45 - 9 hours - Don't need to sleep`,"2005__00044":`any money today - it's dwindling down. I still want a screen door - and carpet - but most of all an exercise spa - I'm waiting until this cut scan tomorrow.

Watched another super "House" always leaves something funny in it.

I think I found my exercise place. "Curves" right down by the secondhand book store - I can have the first week terms free - gave her my name and said I'd be in tomorrow aft. Nice gal with R. I put wrong zip on R's necklace.

I called Paul & he said he might go with me to Jolly Mons this aft. To call him at 2:30 - he asked me if I had received those other papers about Brida and I said "No" - if he doesn't go I'm not either.

Paul did go - we had a great time. He's a nut - has all these money schemes - We think Steve would be a good boy friend for me! How insulting - that boring small little cold guy (and stinks too) - But boy it was fun - I left him off in front of Cricks.`,"2005__00045":`Then May 12. Day started off - knocked my best wine glass off & broke it. Nuts! Big day - Cat scan - need to shower, wash hair leave at 10:30 - then this aft go to Curves - take a free week -

A Day from Hell! -

I went to 2 wrong places - First upon 9 where I had X-ray but no MRI's - no record of me they said other MRI off of 19 - so I thought it was Rose Radiology down Tampa to the left, filled out papers etc. found out it was PALM HARBOR MRI

right behind Tampa & 19 (back in hiding) - at least she will tell me the MRI & it only took about 8 m

Came home had glass of wine & mapped - slept until 4. R called and`,"2005__00046":`then I watched 70's show - always funny!

beads yet - pink + purple + little pink
leaves - Jane birthday - hard to make -

And earning at 3 I went to Jolly Mons - had a good book & 2 wines - came home and ate supper - worked on beads - having trouble - 2 of them have holes too little for the elastic.

I called Shawn - glad I did - I found out he has migraines too but didn't know what they were! I told him to go in a dark room with a wet rag. Also told him I'd send Michelle a necklace - better get on her good side (for Shawn's sake).

Monday May 16 Up at 6:15 - watching "Desperate Housewives" well - found some red lipstick cheap at Bealls - then (had already got coffee wine at Sandlot) went to this "Fit After 50" run by short stock lady used really bad English but - the $39.95 a month stopped me - was much - about 15 machines around the room - a machine tells you where to go taking turns around the room - Foey - came home watching "Matlock" - making pot pie glass of wine. I decided to give that really pretty pink "leaf" necklace.`,"2005__00050":`earrings. Also finished a cute blue & red necklace & red earrings.

Wow!—when I told Jan she said I'd be really nervous of hit men—HA—It makes sense to me if they are giving me $10,000 + Paul 2?—just wish they'd hurry.

Still not sure about my car brakes—watching a crazy "Raymond"—The Motive Day story.

Wed May 25 6:30

Corotid Ultra

take up & leave with Mike's mechanic.
I'd be without it tomorrow.

Well! - Ultra trend over - laying on
back worst part - made funny like
Wumpa Wumpa Wumpa - only right side

sign - not sure what it
means?

Christie - I have one more to read.

I am broke now - don't care -
They are taking me to supper - I said Jolly Mons would be fine.
John served me a slice of Ice Cream Cake with a candle & gave everyone else a slice too. Also a chicken wing - stood buddies.

I think the car was $380.00 -
Terrible - poor kids - Mike said something about Ashley stuff all over the frosty mom? - It's 5:16 and I'm waiting for them to come get me.
They took me to Jolly Mons. I had shrimp (feet on) place.`,"2005__00069":`Enough for lunch tomorrow! - However I have exactly $2.50 & I have to get Emil a birthday card - $.50 + 35¢ stamp = $.85

Glad I have enough food (wine) & gas - I do have $8 in my acct - Ha -

To a super guy who has added so much to my sisters life - H.B.

Man, am I lucky - with such super kids - I called Denis & he called back - felt bad he forgot my B - put $50.00 in the card! - from rags to riches.

So I'm set! - went down I got 40 out went to Jollie Mona - read my new book & enjoyed watching people - back at 4:30 - Now I'm making supper - pork steak`,"2005__00070":`pot salad & Lima beans - watched a funny movie "Free Money" (Starks cute & "70's" on now - really love it -

I wish it was Tue or Wed (pay day) and everything back to normal & am thinking about keeping Andrew for awhile down here - a week? Well or maybe all summer?

Well I had some - came home after 2 wines at Cricks - it was easy - only saw Diane & Art then went to Comm. Marcy "bartender" wedding reception - I thought Paul was there - guess he`,"2005__00071":`left - Decided not to stay - walked around the building and came home watching TV - about serial killers -

Monday Memorial Day - May 30 Woke at 5 but went back to bed - up at 5:45 - Six 7:00 now - have a backache - I'm on that pad - Getting Andrew today - Things we can do - Library - Causeway - our pool table - shuffle board? - thrift shop

8:30 - not sure what to do.

Well - quite a day - finally took Andrew to Dunedin pool - he had a ball & did too - also there was a big inflatable slide there that was fun. Then at 3:30 up to Sheila's - wonderful food - everyone there Maria Elena kids & Ashley - We are watching GSR & it's pretty sad -

May 31 5:45 - a terrific lightning storm! Anyway yest. After I got up Andrew came home - then went to the store - ate ham sandwich chips and jello - went to Dunedin pool & wrote this. Left Andrew on the couch. I slept - he watched TV - I turned out light & TV off at 10 - cat located`,"2005__00072":`out on porch at 3 - but poor thing terrified of the storm - We ran under my bed - just ventured out at 7 - I found out Andrew can't tell time so I'll try & help him - drew a clock I guess he has the idea - tested him a bit.

10 to 12 - Quite a morning. We took my movies back out of all things I forget to take my purse! So no library card - Nuts - Came back - got my purse - went to the thrift shop on 19th and got Andrew a big bag of toys (can only 3.19) - home - made lunch - talked to R. (negative again) "didn't have a pool here?" she thought it did - Had she known I don't - not sure what gets into her - Ate some sort of pot pie - had wine - needed it.

6:00 - well good nap - had lunch at Andrew's - thought Andrew was "next" - I didn't watch TV - finished through life - I went to bank at 3 and put $33 in - I wanted him to cash for me deposited it - So - got $20 out - 13$ left in + 6 = 19$ - Still OK.`,"2005__00073":`We played pool - gave him money for clinta & etc. Also bought him new socks - also 5$ toy collection (write this) Ruthie called - she got my necklace & really liked it & the earrings - asked what I'd charge - I said 10$ neck & 5$ for earrings.

Wed-June 1 Last night I weighed 183 - that's enough - today 180.5 - just coffee for dinner writing down everything - I need gas for car. Last night I noticed guys car litter (red stop litter on rear) back on - but should I tell him? I finally did - little guy had on short underwear & a shirt - he didn't say thanks (or anything) ha - but he got them out -

Another $10 mystery - I got my balance - it said $47.3 minus & figured I had 6 or 7 in there - put in 313.30 & took out 28

39 left in so what is this shit? - But it still gave me 10$ to put gas in - & said -57 - Oh well - I've got enough to last tomorrow - I need stuff get OK`,"2005__00074":`I called the stupid bank. They just didn't get it put in—and gave me money I didn't have—Ha!—so they took off the overdraft charges—shouldn't have been on anyway!

Had a nice nap & then went to the Causeway—my book time was—It was super—no sun & no people—a little sailboat and a few sea gulls—now just ate baked pork steak—6 potato puff & broccoli—jello & banana—watching TV's show—so funny—

Then June 2nd at 5:35—slept good—for awhile thought it was payday—wait—that tomorrow—Oh well—Raining—Read the paper—Cats on lap—drooling away—I made a really pretty necklace yesterday silver bangle beads & those purple stones & earrings—not sure what to do with them? Consignment store?

I went to K-Mart and walked—It's so empty of people—a huge place & about 5 customers

Made another neat necklace—wood & mother-of-pearl & earrings—what to Pearls this stone`,"2005__00075":`To catch them now—11—just ate
Now 1:10—had a short nap—washed
hair—am thinking about going back

much too—so—I have a painful corn
on my left big toe—inside.

5:45—went to Cricks I had fun
of course Kaw.—found out just ignores
him—he gets nice. Doc there too—the
that cute Matt + art—later little
gay? gay (got) Kaw. went out by him ?? is Kaw

Called Jan to leave a message—she

sell`,"2005__00076":`Well had a great time at Cricks. Lynn came in—like both are beginning to think Karika may be gay—He's really nice to little Don—& makes wise cracks at John (who is gay) at first it was so boring—Then I love then Lynn & Art & Alice—Lynn won once—& gave her lots of answers—One funny thing—goofy Doc borrowed 10¢ from me—then he left without paying—Karo brought him back & he had lots of money in his billfold—so now I'll see if he pays me tomorrow.

Had a NIT—James (Lynns hubby) NIT & clocked around—if Lynn can forgive him—I can—

Watching "Raymond"—the Thanksgiving show—he puts the fish in the dishwater

Sat June 4 Up at 6:15—laid awake middle of the night though—a little worrying about cat. We tipped all our bed on the porch—Last nite I called Sheila & asked them to come down today & put up curtains—turn bed & take my out off the back porch—so I hope they come down—I'm tired of looking at these Curtains—`,"2005__00077":`Re-read whole (pitiful) diary - no money from Brian - I'm getting ready but will call Sheila before I leave to see if she is coming down. She's coming around 11 - I went to Helen's Boutique not open yet - doubt if it's a consignment store? Wonder if I could work there? $2 an hour? or percent of sales? She has her phone no. in white pages - she went up to get longer curtain rods - nuts - ones I got too short - But she's been gone for 45 min.

Got back with not only long rods but some really great plug-in "smell good" stuff - we didn't take up the rug - she thinks it's just pretty box smell - nuts - Anyway curtains look great - put ones I had in Street dining room in front & new green blue ones up in the dining-room -

This Helen's Boutique isn't open yet doesn't answer the phone - maybe I could run it?

Had fun at Cricks - after Art came in - I won 3 games first - then Chicago kept won - then Art - Sally & I think he's kind of cute - I haven't won him - now if he shows up at Jolly Man's tomorrow - I'll be sure`,"2005__00078":`had intricated in me home fate kitty on top.

A funny deal with Verizon—got a bill—hoping it wasn't really high! It was a $38 refund (coming soon) so I put $60 back that I saved out for tel—

I went to thrift store on Main—no good curtains but a cute top—wore little snowflakes in silver sleeveless move today—+ earrings Lynn gave me looked OK—a writer told me she called & asked for me earlier? After I left I went to Comon (no doc) only 6 in there

Really weird thing—WTF—went to tiny screen in the corner. Couldn't hardly see it but kept punching in numbers—finally—I was 18th in nation & bar 15th—because I kept playing—got a free drink! Then finally Kawika in—Alain & Heather—she pretty nice—of course I was last—who cares? We won in 3 games—and now have $2,100 or so—Super—only spent $17.00—watching TV—taping Tony Awards for tomorrow.

Kawika said he might change jobs—bartender—boss said he could make $4,000 in tips—wouldn't doubt it. The old "Golden Eagle"? That Johnny—what's it to—to—hope he does—maybe can't come to bar as much—he went to his aunt's—wait on us—watching a funny—King & Queens—didn't see before—Crazy people—

beautiful day out - I may start a new
book (Evanovich) and go to "jolly mans" this
afternoon - going to Wal-Mart & get more blue
beads -

Got those & a new pillow`,"2005__00082":`and more beads - also Woman World magazine worrying about Ruth again. She was busy but now not home at 10 usually mean one or the other is in hospital or sick.

This time she just got busy forgot she hadn't called. I got a job! Cute little Boutique down the street called "Helen's" ha - I had decided to forget it when she called me today. She just is so liberal with money her merchandise - I said I'd work for $6 an hour & mark down on merchandise. She gave me some beautiful turquoise clocks & I was there 2 hours (+ she gave me $4) went to Beef Oh Baby's had great Philly beef sandwich & 2 beers - home & napped until 4:15 watching YAR - she wants me at 9:00 tomorrow - worse thing about the job is the little grand daughter - gobby loud out of control but kind of cute - so I'm better salesgirl & baby sitter - maybe I can get her to make beads Helen is Catholic & her hubby Chinese Helen Chung - really gobby red high piled hair - black mascara over & under her eyes - But it's`,"2005__00083":`exciting - one dumpy little lady came in looking for a short white skirt - she got it on & couldn't get off - Helen had to go in and literally pull it off of her - now I have a problem - shall I tell R? I know I could get off when she comes over - she still is - maybe I'll lose into it just tell her I've gone in there etc., and about the fat lady & skirt - watching such a funny "Raymond"

Other June 9

Had trouble sleeping but finally up at 6:30 - washed my hair & will put up - first ironing my new slacks - decided to tell R - will be interesting to see her trying not to be negative - Anyway - I'm happy

Well - poor little thing - had diarrhea of b.p. 198 again - but she tried to be enthusiastic "How about that" and it will be irritating - so we cut our talk short - I ironed my new slacks - just love them - one of the beads & make look really good with it - I wouldn't be surprised if Helen called for me to come in earlier - I will straighten out that little girl Charlene? Maybe get her to making beads?`,"2005__00084":`Well—low blow—Helen called—things not going well—didn't need me today or this week end—would call me early next week & think she decided to hire a younger "manager"—full time—she knew I couldn't do that—so nuts—glad I didn't buy shoes (or anything else) well—I take a nap & maybe go to Jolly Mous—or Cribs—I'm disappointed—I thought I finally had something to do—Oh well!—Life goes on.

bridges — if he is there at 3 tomorrow
it may be something. He has 4 daughters

Sat June 11) Last night was horrible! —
at 2:00 had to go to toilet (for some
reason) decided to get weighed — it said
186.5 — so I laid awake staring — then stiff
to eat & drink — water subside — started
training really hard — cat jumped bed —
finally slept until 6:15 — T. — scale
said 181.5 — but an hour later 182.5

Ruthie called — told her about scale;
at 8:50 going to have a lot for
groc. — all healthy stuff — I will lose
weight — need to quit so much beer & choco
these & should go at 3 — told Larry I
would.

Also Monday got to Stapey (my mom
in Tampa) for a "free day" at 9—
eating lunch — salad — ½ tuna — and
maybe I can — if I gather to put the
75$ in with monthly payment — or
not (they have a heated pool)`,"2005__00087":`6:25 - Well had fun - but not at tricks - 
game out again - had 2 down beers -
then went to Eldon - met nice couple
"Jzy" & "Corma"? - anyway - I win a
couple games then they did, had 3 beers
and then home - had three lime beans &
cottage cheese - Watching a cute
"Star Wars" show - shown. E woke me

the way in the car - should have gone
before I left - oh well - & went surprised
Kitty on lap - It's almost 8 - I'm sleepy
now - But may try & watch -

Sunday - June 12 - Well - It's 5:15 - at
my smoke alarm went off! Kept
keeping it on - I looked at everything -
in outdoor - finally made it in so
I was I called 911! She told me they
were on their way (firetruck) & to get out
of house - it was - they were there in 5
minutes - (no siren thank goodness) going
to get - he took it down - asked if I
did anything to it? - no - the gal looked
around with a heat detector - nothing at all -
only after he took the battery out it
still beeped - Ha - I'll bet the whole`,"2005__00088":`neighborhood, was wondering what's going on? I quit taking those pills & I think my weight gets lower. It was 180 on digital & 178 on all ones.

6:00 - paper probably not here until 5:30.

10-11 - I may decide to go to Eddie's & play the game - have been 250 - 14 tip. They pay an hour or 1/2 - I guess the fact on money $120 - plus him $60 - maybe some from Brian? I do want to go - spa - go there every afternoon after the game? Or instead of - tomorrow will tell after I find out about the amount due payment.

6:30 - Had fun at Cricks - mostly because Larry came in - the guy I met Friday - he's an alcoholic - also very bloody Marys really fast - he's a diabetic - had heart operation etc. We had fun - that Kate came + Alan & Heather. New extra annoying - back was 54 - also Edgerton Coast Guard sailing ocean all his life - something within from skin (in the millions) HA - what a jerk but I'll see if Larry is there tomorrow. I had me give him a kiss - ? ? ?`,"2005__00089":`We also drove a new big van (I think it was him) so I know he has some money (at least) do I want to get married? Why not? I'm not doing anything else.

Jan called - told her my job gone - also about Larry - watching an Egyptian documentary - But sleepy now - bed at 8 Monday June 13 well - I have to go to the Spa this morning - It will be a money deal if I join - Today I need to do wash

call office
call Brian 31 after mail
call Denis

The Spa was wonderful! Forget they have a great hot pool - huge & hot the pool was cold but OK after in - She & I talked money - its down to 60 dep. + $35 a month - $12.00 altogether with tax - after 2 years its 15$ a mo. She said I'd wait until the 21st to write so it won't be due the 5th - So I called Bro - will mail $60 + Denis extra 20? tried Mike - line Busy`,"2005__00090":`Well, had fun at Cricks - Terry was there at 3 and he showed up shortly - he even played "trivia" but said it made him feel hurt. He just drank single bloody maries - but left. Took my phone number - will be calling. He has so many things wrong with him mostly drinks way too much - Heath terrible - but he's funny - about 65 + think. I asked him to come meet me at 3:00 at Cricket. I'd take him to "Jolly Mon" - he took my phone number - will see.

The jury found Michael Jackson not guilty on all counts - if God gives me a chance I'll go back to R. She can't go in R.P. tube - what? her blood pressure? skin - he holds - she does - stress eye burn - I was so modified at a little tiny bit ago up to now. She just felt negative I can't help it - she never has until 2:10 any fun - I guess.`,"2005__00091":`June 14

Had a good night's sleep.

5:45 - 6:17 AM - I need garbage bags.

Not much energy. I think I'll go to Jolli Mona (whether Larry calls or not) again.

Getting tired of Erica - at least no laws.

Yesterday - Dad had been in the hospital, but signed himself out. I told him to fix his bill.

I had heard about it, but was ugly. I'm going to call Paul today - money? I need to get that folder with my info in it at Shapes. I'll see how my asking for money works.

$100

$90

Save for next month - 10% out of bank on the 5th.

I talked to Paul - he said "Don't anyone get a hold of you." I said "NO" so he said I was having lunch with Jason. I had lunch with him already. Haven't heard from Larry yet - may not be that far. It's a wonder this guy is even alive - the biggest alcoholic I know - drinking in his office - working until he goes to a bar - 4 or 5 doubles or single shots every day, then buys a bottle to take home. Doesn't eat - passes out in bed - stays all over the next day. He has diabetes and a heart by pass.

If R doesn't come over (don't think she showed) I'll send back $10 - then if Brian sends $60 - I'll be OK.

I'd really be nervous about R if I didn't know she needed a cat soon - they take time to set up. They better not find anything - I can't leave until she calls. Watching "Indiana Jones."

A GAW - we run life -

I called Linda again - she just left R - they still aren't sure - they think it's some stomach virus - anyone they may keep her until diarrhea is gone. She should call me - Brian sent the $60! a mile - he thinks I just drinking - poor JJ -

Friday—Feb-17
Had fun at Eddie's—
gave Karen her tiny bracelet 
again—didn't cry me—left $1.75 tip. 
Sat at end of the bar to get away 
from Krazy—moved up after Clan got 
there, met a cute girl named Renee—
she met a cute guy named Ric—got home 
packed by climbing—now Josh says he 
filled up his car & table so I have 
to get my own table—what OK, one 
by the bed—need to buy some 
balloons—
Got 2 balloons—& 
2 feet of pipe!—He let me get him 
one 5 so I'm made /5/7`,"2006a_00064":`good - since I've spent £17 - but I bought a really nice blue carpet for £5 & a nice little table for £2 & Sheila came down & helped me put it down in the front room - really looks nice - it's 12x8! my new little one in the living room - poor old guy might not have sold any furniture or much else - I'm getting sleepy - I'll just cover up my head & take a nap.

I did - then brought them in & went to Jollimors - they were so busy I had to sit inside - got a ham & beer - when a chair opened outside I asked them to get rest of lunch & sloppy bag & bring me another beer. But - they threw it out so made me another one - but they gave me £4 too much - should have been 9 or 10 - £14 - oh well - but it still makes me lonely to see all those people together & dates & families - oh well - came on home - finished my book - going to clean house a little & washes etc.`,"2006a_00065":`Sunday Feb 19

Up at 5:30 — as soon as it's light I put my head back out today — the Spa at 10:30 — home & eat & nap & then the library & maybe Eddie's or not — if I can get some good movie — I still have about $84 — need ear drops — bread — milk & buttermilk.

6:45 — waiting for the paper — it's finally here.

Cat got out again! Just pushed away new screen — & than it all covered up now — looks awful. So go to the store — buy bread & milk.

5:30 — had a nice nap — got bread & buttermilk — also my favorite shrimp混凝土 — went to library & got 5 movies — then to Eddie's — wished Ozzie & his girl friend — gave her my bracelet — wished her best & fuzzy after I helped him a couple of times.`,"2006a_00066":`Anyway—fun—lots of stupid questions about the car races—Brody did win that—nuts—anyway came home & fixed my shrimp stuff & watched a good odd movie "How to Kill Your Neighbors Dog"—Benneth Brendan—funny too—talked to Brian—in Seattle—didn't get in—& now will be back on the 3rd—

Monday—Feb 20

Up at 6:20—did some work around drawers etc—the closet in the back porch—watching "Desperate Housewives"—to a hot. At 7 mopped—went to spa—terrible deal—those 3 gals—one high pitched voice never quits talking—and drove us all out—I wish I'd asked her when she came—so that I don't have to.

AND—a crazy deal at CVS when I went back to get my ear drops—she said I couldn't get until tomorrow—if I could get them they would cost $85.00—only`,"2006a_00067":`98 tomorrow. Well why didn't she tell me this morning? I better be able to get it tomorrow! I caught Kitty trying to get out again!

Tue - Feb 21

No drinking yet. Good girl (according to my dopey scale) I lost 3 lbs yet! Anyway my money is better - what about my hair? It's terrible! Ate oatmeal-skipped bread - low cal TV - going swimming at 8:15 - then I'll pick up ear drops.

Had good quiet swim. Ate lunch - watched YAR - napped - going to watch a baked potato movie on DVD - already saw it - chicken so came out & read - now ate spinach supper -

Wed - Feb 22

Day started out Super! Sheila came by gave me 20¢ & darling pic of loyalt - in an alligator suit with a bone in his hand smiling. Just adorable - I'm sending it to magazine for sure! Also My Invitation!`,"2006a_00068":`is beautiful in a large envelope with a silver 
lining and fastened with a silver white bow
very proper and neat! Also pearl beads and
little blue ones, but holes too small to put on
elastic! I'll have to put on wire and have a
fastener. Put up hair in hot rollers and it's
7:30 - have an hour and 15 minutes to get ready.
Got there at 10 til - door doesn't open until 9 -
About 9:30 Dr. started the "torture test" once
he turned it off  and I thought "AH" but he 
turned it back on - Said to keep putting in 
drops and back in 2 weeks - NUTS - I was 
hoping the torture was over! buying drops
Took a nap - up and started on Ashley's 
anklet. It was too little holes for
elastic so I found some wire and made it
one strand with pearls and blue beads and another 
plain pearls wrapped around it. It's sort 
of loss on me so it should fit. I put a small
clasp on it. Cute.
   Sheila surprised me last night by 
popping in  - had a super sandwich and another 20$!
Wotta gal - gave her the anklet.
`,"2006a_00069":`I need some envelopes - I stationary, thing to open at 11:30 - may get them at Walmart or drug store - waiting for R. to call but she may have had to go to eye Dr. called - was just leaving. Will call back. I went downtown got envelopes and writing pad & set Dr. a letter - asking for my blood test results. Mailed - watching a show about Heidi Fleiss - "Hollywood Babylon". A slut - liked money & motorcycles.

Had dinner nap - watching TV then sleep - Hope "Gabby" isn't there - if she is I'll find out her hours she comes.

Had nice swim - no "gabby" - stopped at Koch & Harry & got salad stuff fruit mix & tomatoes. It's 3:00 - till bill $8.32

Long day - 6:00 now.

Cheap skate Emil doesn't want R to drive

Maybe spo—maybe Eddie—wine & coffee

Don't feel like swimming or doing wash—
No motivation—He—watching "Rockford
Files"—always cute—Think I'll eat,

raining—watching funny "cops" on goofy
things actors do—their flops fights etc.—

Monday - Up at 5:20 - not bad - laid awake trying to decide if to go to the office or not about 1606 & think I will though - my ear feels totally well. Watching an old "Lost World" - I've seen them all 2 or 3 times - 9:15 - finished my book - walked - my back started hurting & my neck - took pills for pain (case) no money today that's OK.

Hopped - watched YTR - then went to 1606 again - no answer - so I went to office she didn't live there last year she is in the hospital - So - she thanked me for`,"2006a_00073":`being concerned.— So I went to our library & got out 4 good books—one by Block—(may have read it but hope not)—Read it nuts!

Sat. March 4

First person I saw at Sh.
was Leon—he looked so handsome—he
lost 50 pounds—Connor is really tall and
funny but Collin is a mess. Boxy and
to himself—& still really jealous of Connor.
Michelle was very friendly and gave me a big
hug. So dramatic though—& stiff says
"there you go" about everything. Jim was
trying to get Brian to get him a bachelor`,"2006a_00079":`party started. Instead Brian had a beer! gave me his car keys to keep - Leon had his jet ski boat there & took the boys out. Corner fell in & he - They (all but Brent & April) went on a "beer run" & to get groceries were gone 3 hours. Sheila started making hamburgers but I left - getting dark. What a mob! - wonderful!

Big news is Cat is gone! - I can't figure out where he got to - I have the back door open & lit on back porch when it's light out. I'll go looking for him. Pokey. Getting hair fixed at 10.

Drove around looking for Cat - no luck - also asked "John" (tricycle man) to watch out for him & think someone has Kitty - going to put up notice in campground.

My hair looks gorgeous! He took care of each twist & turn lots of time. Name is Reuben - he owns the place in a young Porto Rican.`,"2006a_00080":`(probably gay) only charged $15 - I paid $20 - really luck good - Hope it lasts well - mopped & then went to
she, at 3 - all the girls were out shopping,
they didn't get back until 5! - I was pretty
upset and when she said
"It's all about you isn't it?" I was really
dumbfounded - but then later - a real
shock - Physiss was standing there -
ye gods - shell push into anything of our
family - of course I recovered & had to be
nice. She left to go get Molly - then
LeeAnn brought in Wyatt - what a
doll he is. Once he found this mag rock
& drugged it across the room & then
pulled it up and looked so
proud of
himself - Ha - he has a little tuxedo to
wear - got some pics with kids - I
came home at 6 - NO CAI - Everyone said
he'll come back - ?? not sure`,"2006a_00081":`March 5 - 2006

- Wedding Day -

Finally - Hallelujah! My hair was really bushy when I got up. Hope it will go down. Hope so. My bills are all paid - still shocked about Phyllis + Sheila's remark. Oh well - she's under lots of pressure. Tomorrow things will be back to normal - I hope.

No Kitty - nuts - It's cold out too. 10:30 - went down to J&J store - got Kleenex + black nylons - groc at Save A Lot -

Brian called and wondered if I wanted to come up - I said NO. He could get me at 5:30 - So - napped - made some beads - made coffee + tea next - then got ready - I decided to wear little pink blouse + black slacks (but dress just wasn't me)`,"2006a_00082":`Almost 4 - I'm getting antsy - had a good shower - applied cold cream on my face - cleaned teeth - etc.

What a slut! - & she was all over at the wedding "Helping out" - And Mike P. & I got closer - Maria had us take a pic - I said "I guess we can get that close without killing each other" - He put his arm around me and said "you know I love you Mary"! after all you gave me skills - I said that night - everyone was taking pictures I'm taking my pics up to Wal-Mart or get faster (but cost more) at CVS.

Cat is Back!`,"2006a_00083":`John (tricycle man) knocked on the door & said he saw Kitty run in back of my house—so I got dressed & opened back door & in he ran! Looks tired & scared & has burrs in him. He drank a lot & ate some. He was gone 3 minutes! So he loved to be here—He's sleeping in the closet right now.

Mike & Mary & Denis came down—they got stuff they'd left here to store. We all talked & I called Ruth & told her they were coming over tomorrow—Mike put my clothes out—they left & kissed them all goodbye. Almost 7 & I'm really sleepy. Watching a funny Raymond—

swim - watching Ellen now - she is
a nut - so much fun!

I had a great talk with Jan - She
did go on the stupid cruise - and said
that Connie really blew up and said
she ruined everything - Jan told her off
though, said last year she asked a fourth
gal about telling her & she needed to be
there for her mother - I told her to never
feel bad about that - I never liked Connie
Connie went out (to bed) with Dan - her
husband - Jan will be down in Jan a few
or sooner - Act or Not - Hope so!`,"2006a_00127":`Wed - April 19

What an aft went to Spa at 2:45 - at Tampa. I had a red light + cars kept coming so I couldn't turn. A bull once + then a school bus - so I waited until I got the green - as I turned an old coot drove up next to me + hollered "why didn't you turn?" "why did you wait?" I said "shut up you old coot - did it again + he drove off. I got up`,"2006a_00133":`met him later & he rolled down his window so I put my music up really loud and smiled at him & he drove off. Then of course "old grey bun" was in the pool. Tabby - never again at 3 on Monday - so when I got Lynn's number I was glad - may meet her tomorrow. If she calls, watching a funny Raymond still no cat. - I hope she comes back - I miss her a lot! I think I'll act & if I don't do my cell phone deal,

Feel about half sick at my stomach. Hangover! - anyway ate 1/2 of Sheila's lunch from yest. & hope I'm not getting flu - (I think it's all the shrimp & wine from yest.) Called Jan & left message. I threw up but not much. Still feel icky - made a cheese sandwich. Had a nap. It's 3:20 - I am still sickish nuts - at least I didn't spend any money at all today.

Talked to R - they are taking Linda out to supper & Sat night. She moves July 8 - I know R is devastated about it. She still has Kimberly - not much to do today - I have plenty of food & wine (for today) I have to take Karen DVD's back. She has "Shark Tales" for me - & missed Neil Armstrong yet. He is so`,"2006a_00189":`Cute funny—
Stupid gal on millionaire—Had to use all her "help" by $8,000—only one left. She didn't know anything—Took her $8,000 + left.—I should go—
10:45—Watching Rockford—I went to Kashi & Harry—Had $4.33 worth of coins—So I have 18¢—pitiful!—only need 2¢ today—I got coffee creamer—
Fixing chicken & broccoli & cottage cheese & wine—going to watch YAR then mop, make some red earrings—May give to Crystal or Stacy—really don't want to encourage her though—these in her new best friend—Eek!
My goofy cat just nibbled at my elbow—He's nuts—
7:20—Got the phone call—It has 6 calls on it to St. Johns, Florida—
I called Brian before I checked the number—It's Rutha—I'll ask her about it—Watched 2 old "movies"—Didn't like either one too much—`,"2006a_00190":`Nothing to do today, may try to get a book at Club House & swim this afternoon. Called R. and found out St. Johns is her County name—why now? She was still interrogative. She's going to find out.

1:45—Wopped from 12 to 1:30—out of wine—guess I'll get some more. Too hot to swim—no Eddie—not much on TV.

2:30—Calm & happy—On a hunch I tried Denis Card—there was $6.3.00! I forgot to get it out this month. Now I'm fine until Sunday—I won't have to ask Sheila—Yah! got wine ribs potatoat corn at Winn Dixie & a magazine.

Ate at 3:50—very good—watching an old TV show & already ours—"Journey to Center of the Earth"—

Man—it started pouring down—both windows were down in the car—I just ran out—got soaked—put up window—really wet—now of course it's stopped.`,"2006a_00191":`Sunday - June 25

Had this book already so I'll start it - Brian reading. We took the air bed down already - it's leaving this aft. I washed my hair - just letting it dry - not getting it up. Talked to R. May go look at thrift shops for new T-shirts or button shirts - want a bright red shirt. Went to Sheriffs by Elder - none big enough for me - L + 16 doesn't fit it. But I found some super never worn Naturalizer size 10 - white - oh well - only $3.00.

Got tired into Bealls - they had a lot of cute stuff for houses - no blouses - got tired and came home. Brian listening to Bush talk about terrorists - he wants me to worry about them not the economy.

12:30 - we left & drove in a pouring down rain & could barely see. We stopped in a "Whataburger" I got coffee & a Jr. H. Brian got a big one & f. B. & ice tea. We drove to Sheila & he put stuff around my left head light out.`,"2006b__00003":`skipped from Cremation called - Help be here Mon. at 9:30 - Like to have Sheila here?

He went in - it doesn't open until 4 - So went back to Norton's - Azzie in there we played another game - he always loses - but Vinta guy - he always won - had salad

Sat Sept 19 Up at 6 - Wonder if Leon will want to go to Norton's? Yesterday Azzie said Karen looks miserable - He's also mad at her for not getting that job at Martinez - because she didn't go back. - I'm afraid she is drinking too much on the job. Azzie`,"2006b__00004":`doesn't like her boyfriend either. I still have $242 - not bad for the 10th - and lots of food -

10/20 - Ate small salad, crackers at time, went to sheriff's thrift - got you a beautiful "angel" candle holder - was $6 - down to $3 - for Xmas - I'll give those earrings to Michelle - I love getting Xmas presents early - ate strawberries, grapes & kiwi for dessert. Watching a story about early apes! Some disgusting of course. Early walking hips - not too far from some men - HA

Went to Spa - 1:15 to 1:45 - then home - made another big salad - wine - laid down again - up at 4 - "Discovery" had series on pre-historic animals - so huge - pachycephalosaurus - water animals - like huge whales - now Greenland Sharks - ugly suckers had ice cream, strawberry, choc sauce -

Decided to start taking care of my skin - may get a 32¢ jar of "Uplifting Cream from Avon."

Well - 1:30 and I've been sick - It was that damn avocado - I knew it was rotten on one side - I just cut that off & ate it all - it may have been way too rich or rotten - when I started feeling terrible I just went to bed - pretty soon too sick to lay there so got up & thumb down the throat - lots of icky green stuff & felt better - slid back down. Watching TV - may eat some rice & hard boiled eggs - Made it potato soup. Still weak - also ate the egg - feel better - waiting for Sheila to call me - then I'll call Charlie & Avon.

I should have lost weight today. I've had 2 coffees - br. food banana + a rotten avocado - then bowl of potato soup - egg watching a show about "Defectiti"`,"2006b__00007":`Those kings & queens didn't live very long about 30 years'—but ahk amen—19—

Cleaned the front-room—except vacuum—I'll do that in the morn.

Monday—Sept 11 9-11—probably all well hear today is the "bombing"—5 years ago.

just the stuff for my forehead—finally OK but
had Sheila drive me home—act followed. I threw
up everything—(mostly olives) and took a nap
for 1/2 hours—watching TV—ate an egg
sandwich. Still weak and feel icky—
my goofy Avon gal called & said she
was bringing my lipstick—took her & was
sick & she said she'd leave it & the change for

The Sept 19 I got up to a really funny call from Russell. He said it was 5:30 o'clock time. Guess I was at the post store or post office. I'll call him about 10 - my hair looks cute (again) - "Pookie" driving me nuts. Ha - he went out on back porch - I decided to take`,"2006b__00021":`all of Brian's heavy jackets to the
Sheriff's station. Maybe clean up
the beads etc. I hope it starts
cooling off.

11:30 - had a long funny talk
with Russ. We talked at length about
Phyllis. He said toward the last he
thought she was a gold digger + conniver.
He told him about Molly not
taking any pics of me or Michelle at the
wedding - also said to get out of it he
started really drinking tequila - they had nothing
in common. It worked I guess. He said he
thought it was the because Sun football
was on Sat - so Sun was more than the - Ha -
Anyway it was a fun talk - 12- almost
time a nap then Martini's

Rewinding YAR - I had a funny
deal - thought it was a migraine so I
took an imitrex and fell asleep on it
and laid down for 2 hrs. Watching YAR
then I guess martini's`,"2006b__00022":`"Martini" is cute - Park + like a cute club. Beer is $1.50 - Karen told me a 1/4-2/4 go along with that - ha - just had 2-6 of us.

12:30 ate a pea, bitter + cracker sand + milk and a democet. Back at 11:00 + slept good until 6'1 - Took a hot shower feel better. Called the paper - tomorrow morning - don't know what to do today. Skip the Martini Club I think -

Now I'm worried - 15 after and`,"2006b__00023":`no R - shall I call again? - yes
wait until 8:30

Now I'm scared to death! It's
9:15 - no R - no one answers at

her dopey husband would be there!
I feel sick at my stomach. I'll be a
mess until I hear. Well - finally got
Linda's husband - R is in the Hospital!
E.R. Kimberly is with her - why haven't they
called me? He said he'd make sure someone
did. Told me he felt great - thought mold
was in their other house. Why didn't it get
Linda then?

Finally! Kimberly called

R is better - just really weak & shaky - her
heart is fine - more meds. to calm her
down. Kindly gave me her number - R will
call when she gets home so I'll go down now.

Got stamps & money order at P.O. (forgot they
had them) Hurried home - knew R hadn't
called - shall probably be until 12:30 -
I made egg plant & bean soup. Love`,"2006b__00024":`nothing on TV - history channel - last W. war -
Ended Forest of Complete - Com-p-e-en' The

out of here - went to Norton's - some slutty
gal sitting on 2 diff. guys laps
and so jerky - then she left to talk to
someone else & it made them both mad at -
then a gal always in there (in pretty sure
is a priest) seems to like block guys.
Karen called - worried about me. So I
better go down or call her every day - if you're
nice to be worried about though.

(Thur. - Sept 21) Up at 6:15 - talked to Jan
She's leaving tomorrow for Calif. She got my
earings - really liked them & the note -
said she'd show it to him as soon as she
got there. Then Philly - then here. Also had
good talk with R. an ordeal - he thinks its
depression (dints) shoulder pain combined with bad
pills. Said she'd fix phone so Emil could use.
Guess I didn't say in here
Denis had a paper printed up (with`,"2006b__00025":`3 guys) in a medical journal!—about ears and the echoes of sound waves etc. So proud of him—called & told him.

But went the second page.

First day it's been cool and wonderful—I have the window & back door open & heat or A/c off. Hope I can keep it that way, all bean soup—til Co. said they have messages being late—fixed—hope so!

Had a great day—nice morning, great nap & then fun at Martini because Boo was there & he is fun.

Had 4—came home fixed pork steak, baked pot & corn—milk & kiwi Bed 8

Oh well—just watched the funniest "Frasier" with "Monk" actor on it—a Hindu that I found out didn't like him.

When she got home he was on his knees—she ran over & tried to pull him up but he fell flat on his back & pulled R on top of him! They couldn't get up. R finally called for help so loud lady across the street heard her & came over. Her husband got them up! Why does E go out when R isn't home? Stubborn old guy!

Down to 29¢ for 4 days—$8.25 a day—Ha—read two papers.

Spent $6.50 on wine—oh sure!—then coming home from the library (after nap) I got polish sausage—made it & put it on pancakes & corn. Watched an old "Poirot" I'd seen before—now a show about Guatemala & jungle gorillas.

R. called — all excited — the WW II meeting she went to was written up in the paper — & she was quoted — me too — as having the idea — being turned down for type — working in a torpedo factory — a pic too but not of R — she sending me one.

Good news — VC is OK. — it's the tapes. — Bought 2 new ones + Y&R is simply really good.`,"2006b__00071":`All about the murder of Orville -

$4 to bar - Fri - ck here - Dr at 9 -

Then Nov 2
Up at 6:30 - talked to R.
Sometimes she is so negative & middeny.
When I said "Karen offered to loan me money"
she said "an enabller" - I said "no for my
own enabller" - she could have said "that
was nice of her" - I think she is jealous that I
have so much fun & friends down there?
Of course if I had to live with Emil I'd be
negative too - just remembered that last mo.
our S.S. class here - on the 2nd - let's
hope - I'm out of pilosec - I have to
go at 11:30 - also wine & a meal - no bar

Blood test day and pay day! Good—10 after 7 and really missing my coffee and food—watching "Ugly Betty"—Cat on lap again—going to bed at 8:45—20 til 8—

Much better now—waited about 10 min—she took 2 vials—I gave a urine sample—got a flu shot & then had to wait 10 min more for an EKG.`,"2006b__00073":`so went out to the car & ate cheese curds
& drank some coffee - also got "crabby nurse
Sheila" too gave me some limonif so it
"frome" was a good morning all together. A funny
watching for the mail man. I haven't
seen this one.

Bummer! - & check wasn't there

why except maybe all politically stuff,
so went to Karen - she didn't come & I
won one trivia - have to eat at 5:30-
Brian called - had good talk - he's a

Laid there another hour, worried about those darn video tapes but called this gal re-newed it for another week—turns out she had optical migraines too. So I'm waiting until dark & go to Winn & get deli food & wine. Went at 8:30—$4.49 & price (lasagna really) + 2 nice nice guy + wine (now $4.99). Plenty of food for tomorrow—I think I have $335.00 plus D. 60 + 33—$378.00.

Sunday—Nov 5

Fell OK—up at 5:45—read the paper—decided to do some trash shopping today—getting the gals pins or both stuff—I think the card store is closed on Sun. Forgot to write in here—WINDSHIELD wiper work!`,"2006b__00075":`Outside Wm. turned motor on & they started! - So glad I had washed the windshield & sprayed it down - Super!

Russell - just had a long talk with Russell - good - asked him to go see Jon. He said he would - we had a great time.

Just had a really hilarious talk with Ruthie - she said a neighbor of hers says "you know" all the time & then we couldn't ourselves saying it a lot & it got really funny - I had to go to toilet - so funny.

11:30 Doing a wash - good looking guy there but of course mentioned his wife. Went to that neat card shop for a card for Jan - but saw these pretty earrings for $5 - got her & Michelle a pair (Jan's are prettiest) She also gave me 15% off - neat store - she got most of my taxes done. I'm short a pie for Shawn & some other - will get in Dec. I need big hopes.

Had fun at Club - Raymond - at last Joe came in - told him about my wipers - he couldn't believe it - I had 4 beers - R bought me one - gave Karen $5 & made her take it.

Need to quit spending now -

Tuesday - Nov 7

Nice talk with R.

Last day of those stupid elections - today is election day`,"2006b__00077":`Just glad it will be over. Almost time for "Rockford" - decided to look for free bottles - none at liquor store - too little - so went to $.10 store - none on sale yet - not right size at P.O. office either.

And $3.50 - I store said they would be getting them in Dec. Come home & found a good box in the back room. Really too big but I put in my pic., calendar, some candle & potpourrie & her pin - ate lunch - pot pie & some peanut wine - watching Price is right" - We have rain coming I guess. I'm going to watch Y.W.R.

6:00 - Had a neat time at bar - Ryan came in - out & helped me in - So sweet. Poor Karen - the people that worked across the street in a "selling cell phone deal" were shut down - no license - So they all came over there at 11 to drink - Place was packed & then toward the last one guy tipped in the men's room & Karen had to clean it up - made her sick - wouldn't take any money & hid a $ under a shot glass - Ha - sun came out, ate TV dinner & peas - watching TV -`,"2006b__00078":`Called Sheila—she's off Friday so I'll go up—didn't say anything about "why didn't she call me?"—just let it go—

Ryan & Raymond are always really sweet to me—I got a fun & a doll! met Melissa—Karen's nurse friend—she hadn't eaten all day & had 3 drinks!—all the elections are on tonight so I'm watching a program on volcanoes—lava is 2,000 °F—yikes—

Wed—Nov-8 Up at 5:30—6:08 & no sugar yet—Had to get up 4 times in the night to go to potty—Nuts—losing ½ yd a day?—Elections over—hurray—Crist got it for governor—at least one Bush is out of office—in '08 will get rid of Bush! just got Shawn's message from last night—He hasn't taken test for 48 hours—if it's for 3rd shift won't take it—he said to call him at 7 P.M.(my time)—I know he said 12 noon—ok well—then we go to Spa today—talked to R—nothing new—watching TV—Elections are over—Whoopie—I remember yest. I was scared to death—the piece I made for gifts here on top of the microwave`,"2006b__00079":`fell on the floor & broke - I was afraid it was the microwave blowing up! Ha-
only I broke - guess it was Karen -
that's OK - decided not to get Denis & Shawn calendars - too big to send - I'll try to find some silver key chain initials - small enough to send.

12:30 - 2:30 R. on - I had a short nap,
going to the Spa afterward - then
maybe the thrift shop on 19 - went
to Spa - but then to Winn for
food & wine. Now watching "Ellen"
so funny - Bed at 8:00 -

Nov 9 Called Shawn at 8 - he said call at 7-
Anyway - Boys went Halloweening as Cowman-Weiner
+ Collin - a hobo - cute - He hasn't taken the
U.S. test yet.

I am getting pretty fed up with Ruth
& her "digs" at me. She talked about her
neighbor that talks so much she can't get a
word in "like you" she said I later said
"I do need a keeper" - then when I
brogged about Deni getting in she said`,"2006b__00080":`"I don't talk about politics" - I said "you did yesterday" - we also disagreed about time zones - so I got a call waiting - she was right and had to call to tell me. I have to look at this psychologically. R. still resents all the years I had the most out-going personality & the most boyfriends and now the most fun. She digs at my drinking, my friends, money etc., etc. - guess I should have called her on the whale-dolphin deal - as quick as I told her she said well they were mammals. I guess living with Emil makes her have to be slight with me. I'll take just so much - called and went to Jan - she agrees that Ruth is unhappy about her life & taking it out on me - she advised me to let it go & ignore that R. is unhappy & taking it out on me - I'll try!

6:00 - Had fun at Clut - won a game from Froggy - $1,300 something - but got beat again - so before I left won again got Raymond & Ryan and I had fun. Came home - made eggs & peppermint`,"2006b__00081":`a baked pot. = It's 6:15 - Hope I can stay up until 8 -

Friday - Nov 10

Lasted until 7:30 - Up at 6 - Have to clear my throat a lot and am short of breathe a lot. So glad I'm going to Dr. today at 11 - then up to Sheila's - So another week almost gone - wonder what Ruth will be like today. She better not "dig" - She was very pleasant - of course we didn't get into anything controversial.

12:45 - Waiting for Sheila to come down - go to lunch - well - Or set up 5 diff. test for me - X-ray - bone scan - stress test (eek) & poop test I gave me flonase for my nose & vytovan for Chole. instead of little pill I was taking. Chole is bad again - But liver is fine! He punched & pummeled books - stomach - groin & ankles. He is still so cute - When I said how did my liver look? He said oh it looked beautiful - best looking liver`,"2006b__00082":`I've been sick of course I meant on paper! - the old fire. Asked me how much I drank & when did I start smoking. I think my shortness of breath bothered them! Almost 2:00 clock & I'm starved.

Sheila & Leon didn't get here until 1:15 - Baby pictures are just adorable! Baby in a bundle bed outfit. Cat once & Loyall too - & Ryan & Lee Ann. Also tried a funny story on Wyatt. In a movie they were watching a van slides down into water. Loyall kept running to the TV and saying "Oh no" "Oh no" "Oh no" and they all cracked up. 6:00 - guess I'll eat a little.

Sat Nov 11 Big decision! Back on veg & fruit - more spa - up at 5:00 - 9½ hours sleep enough! - just sick of this gut - just had a great swim - had to burn at least 500 cal. - ate some salmon & crackers & wine - at 4 got bored & went to Hortons - had ½ Philly chicken & some chips (naughty) & 3 beers - watching America's Funniest Videos - pics of babies`,"2006b__00083":`eating baby food that's sour—Reilly funny

Lost ½ pd - surprised after that beer & sandwich at Norton's. But I did have a good workout in the pool today & can use those "green tea" pills - I did all the stupid "poop" samples. Ugh - let's take it down Monday.

Found a good deal! JoAnne fabrics - real close-up. Curled & has beautiful stuff. Got making for a gorgeous wreath for $10 & another base for one. Will make it for Ashley.

Leon - Had a good talk with Brian. He said his money is fine & still in the bank. He doesn't trust their banks - sometimes they just close and you lose your money. The tap will be fine if he doesn't go in for luxuries like elec. toilet & running water. Ha - what a guy!`,"2006b__00084":`What a day! Had an 1/2 nap & decided to go to Wal-Mart for more pink Angora - none there so I got some white & silver yarn - then thought I'd go to a no-smoke game place - but just couldn't go in. Decided to go to Eddie's - it was crammed with football nuts - so came home & got more money - wine, fruit & 4 lbs green beans, ate half of it & some fruit. Really full now. Watching story about England & old Arthur story - in old Gaelic? Now I've watched the myth of Shangri-la & Jason & the Golden Fleece all based in some historical facts. Really well done and narrated by one guy.

Monday - Nov 13

My favorite day - up at 6 - still short of breakfast. I've lost 4.5 lbs since the 6th - Hope I can keep that up!

Got more stuff at 18 store for $5. It's pretty too.

Bad news - I'm set up for a chemical stress test Nov 27 on McMillan Booth Road - I'll get Sheila to take me - nervous about it. It's at 1:30 - 2 days after Thanksgiving.

Watching family friend - I need 2 AA batteries for the "clicker" remote. Guess I'll buy on the way home from Martini - think I'll dress in jeans + T-shirt.

Had a ball - Boo was there. Raymond & Ron - I won one game 12,000 something - Boo was playing 4 hopes - we had 21 in motion & on board. I stopped & got batteries for my remote when I got here.

old "movie" I saw before - cute thought
then bed at 8 - Jason Alexander in it`,"2006b__00087":`Wed - Nov 15

Up at 5:45 - terrible night when I went to bed! I ate too much catfish & was sick at my stomach! Tried to sit up but finally wiped! Then got to sleep. Re-winding "House" a new one I haven't seen in a while.

Watching YKR when Denis called - needed my address at work to send me money. He said he could use a key chain to fasten his house key too when he was running - So I'll look.

Found one at Card Shop - + neat gold earrings for Molly - want a nice address book (I put all addresses in) for Denis & Shawn - Wal-Mart - Ruth finally called me - She fell asleep after shopping - had good talk - about YKR & my teeth.

Thu - Nov 16

Up at 6:00 on the dot.

Boozy cat up in my face because it was lightning! He hates it. Not sure what to do today. I have to scrub damn floors. Lots of rain. Called Ashley last night she's taking me to`,"2006b__00088":`Hope. Good!... One less worry.
Swept kitchen floor - did dishes -
watching "Rockford" - getting hungry already.
Washed my hair - will put up.
Had good nap - worked good to eat
at 10 - waiting for GHR to quit recording -
then I'll dress & go to club - still need
those batteries.

Guess I'll forget about bear or wait
until pay day & put on the end by knapsack
& wishes. Then later Mercy & Fisky
came in! - I asked them please don't
tell Henika about here! - They told me
"Duc" died 4 days before they found him!
I won 2 games - R called - Kimberly is
preg. - It will be 8 grandkids for R!
Watching "Raymond" where Amy & Robert
make love and their curtains were open.

Friday Nov 17 Up at 6:30! Good -
Paper & coffee then at 9 went to
Wal Mart for address books BUT
saw those great red shirts - written up
front - $14.00 - size 18-20 - so I got`,"2006b__00089":`it instead - It's what I've always wanted in a shirt, Red & button down - so of course I didn't have enough with me to get the address book - Down to $100 ($4 Denis $60?) for 13 days.

(Sat-Nov 18) Up at 6:30 - watching the "Monk" taped + it ran out before the end! I was so MAD but it's on again at 11 - same time I hope. Went to the grocer store - first 10¢ gas then save a lot by mistake got 5.99 "Colossal" shrimp instead of 3.490 Jumbo - so short $1.00 - put back bread - made great shrimp vest rice, pepper dish, new "Monk" came out I hope - then a nap - may try mart. Club play game + Mills - it's a diff "Monk" Don't think I've seen it though - it's the old "nurse" for monk but a new show.

It's 5:00 - I woke up at 2 + decided to go to Mortons to play the game, I won 3 or 4 - only 2 jumps playing against me.`,"2006b__00090":`Then a football started & loud obnoxious fans joined in. But one gal I couldnt take my eyes off - weighed at least 400 pounds ate a big lunch - cheeseburgers & fries stayed until 9:00 came home & ate my super shrimp veg. deal watching "Funny Videos" - "But Mom" was on with George Clooney - it was awful - Uma Thurman too just awful.

Sunday Nov 19 Up at 6 - no papers of course. I'm glad when this week we ordered the stress test - that "monk" was not the one I wanted - NITS - oh well - it will be on. Today I vacuum the floor if nothing else! 12:10 So far no vacuum - but I am through with Xmas buying. I went to Wal Mart - got 2 nice address books. Dr. J's - and a darling red sleeping bag with an embroidered leaf "babies first Christmas" on it. Now I have to put all the boys addresses in. Wenn I had kids dinner - So good`,"2006b__00091":`but really is now making me belch and sickish. Laid down too soon I guess. Watching a rather goofy T.V. show murder etc.

Trying to decide what to do this aft. What a bust! Went to Hortons twice as bad as yet. Smoke + no trivia - so I left - went to Bealls - kind of looking for April - saw cute slippers fuzzy white + sparkles $6.00 - may go back in Dec or just set her 10$ my knee started to give way - so went to store - got 2 wrapping papers & Scotch tapes - also today filled in address books.

Monday Nov 20 Now Nov. getting over - looking forward to thanks but not Xmas - with no kids - I have all my "gifts" but need to wrap also need peanuts (foam) and boxes for pics. Decided to take glass out of pics - and just send copy`,"2006b__00092":`Pic easier to mail. I'll wrap next week—
Mail the 10th of Dec.

I called X-ray place and found out
you can just go in without an appt.
So I'll go in after "frasier"
I did & I'm pissed—co-pay
$5 - never used to be!—so better
find out about stress test, after nap,
Y&R coming on now—after Y&R
had nap—then Club—had a ball—
Raymond got the Bear to working
so cute—a lot very loud fast—
some strangers (8) came in—got martini's
I took him over asked if they'd like to
see my Bear perform?—they got a big
kick out of him, a new guy there played
music at the game. Karen got weepy
(about her daughter & grandson in Arkansas)
So—had 4 beers—played the game—won
3—(lot 2). After 4 came home—Raymond
gave Karen a hot cheese and fries—
she gave it to me—good!`,"2006b__00093":`Two Nov 21

Up at 5:30 - laid awake worrying about money - then remembered I get 10% free groceries from Winn + 25% free food from Publix, also skipping bar today + getting food there from Sheila at Thanksgiving so - have $68 - have to get 20% from Sh. for stupid stress test. I need to get pills from CVS today.

Well - lied like a rug & changed my date to Dec 7 - so - that money problem is over - I'm calling Karen not going to Club today - have to drag store + get my pills + wine + bread - just finished off ribs + corn - now have "Traciert" for them before of course. Thought I'd skip bar but now not so sure - just have so much fun there - Make the most of every day. This show is really funny. About Bull dog and award of the year -`,"2006b__00094":`Well—what a day—First of all had 1/2 bottle wine at lunch & aft. Then went to Club at 3:00. Played two games & had 4 beers—I won 2 games & lost 2. BUT when I went to parking lot to go home everything started going around & around & fell down on my face. I guess because I think I broke my nose—hit my lip—They were so sweet—guy I was playing game against offered to take me home & Joe said he'd drive my car. Karen called—I called Michel—told him to have Sheila call—she did—offered to come down—I said NO—in O.K.—watching "Raymond"—bed at 8 Hope it isn't huge in the morning—my mouth is also sore—Horrible deal—Guess I have to give up wine & 3 beers not 4—give up wine.`,"2006b__00095":`Wed 22

I really look bad now
both eyes - teary
black - cut eye
nose swollen & bright red - Eeek - may
not go to Thanksgiving - have them bring
me dinner. Only had maybe 3 hours of sleep
but I can get some today - going to pour
wine down the sink. I did - called
Mike - said he'd bring lunch - forgot
to tell him I eat early - like now - Ha -
2 funny "Frasiers" - I took a pain pill
11:00 got to talk to Karen - she's stopping after work - decided to go
up at 13:00 if someone will get me - they
will -

Mike finally got here at 1:30
3 tacos - ate two - YAR over - going
to nap - showed him the bear - Ha

Up at 6 -

Got a Super Call - Brian! and an address! Told him about my fall -

Slept from 11 to 12:30 - took a good shower + dressed - jeans + red shirt + tangle up face - HHA -
Fifteen to 2 - leaving at 2:00 -
Hungry - not hungry now of course!
Can't lay down for awhile - ate too much.

sugar eggs etc. I'll wait until 10—
Mail Brian's package too—

Don't feel good—probably alcohol
withdrawal—Sheila said 3rd day of
hits—This is it—3rd day—NO WRITE—
going to put on make up + dark
glasses + go to store. I did get
buttermilk eggs + sugar + ate
too much of leftovers and dressing is
too rich—made me "sickish"—ate
crackers + milk—feel some better. Karen
called so guess I'll go down—
Fun but "Dr. Bill" was there—getting
really loaded—let Raymond help words for some
reason—Joe Camelin + Stacy—then "Wieder,"
I mailed Brian his address book—almost 30
no promises about. Yikes. Karen had me take
bear home and stuck my money back in
my purse—Dr. Bill + Ryan walked me out.
All thanks stuff—no dreams but still too
rich—made me sick!`,"2006b__00098":`Sat - Nov 25

Monk coming on — I have to see the

tape — I've probably seen all but that one —
Can't wait to see me alone —
Sad to say I went and got some wine —
Just poured a glass & had it on the table

me a $20!) I got the glass behind
the chair before she saw it.`,"2006b__00099":`Felt like a skuzzy ball—Ha—Another monk I haven't seen. Food—not going anywhere. Made hard boiled eggs & have some soup.

**Monday Nov 27**

Up at 6:20—my last "monk" was the one I wanted to see—with his "dad"—Talked to R. her shoulders hurting again—she had to crow about snow in Texas State—I told her he said he got mostly rain & no snow—May call him today—I got so MAD at Woolin-Dixie—No 10¢ worth of figroo—gol

Said it's money saved—not money spent—So I got 10¢ worth of TV dinners—not going there again—Will call Publix & see about 25¢ Called Club—going Dec 7th get free food from Publix—after stress test.

Got a neat bunch of pics from R. Darling—cat pics—sleeping & slumped around. Also a cat litter (or paper) mike wrote about name. It's 7/7 and it's read—he was in hell—`,"2006b__00103":`Dec. 1st Pay day & Dr. day - up at 5:45 -

breathing UP - I told her you should breathe OUT deep -
Anyway test people said I'd probably get a 2 on the scale - I got 4 1/2 - 3 times - Ha - that's good - didn't need brothlier afterwards. So good - I've had & wines - or will sleep after YAR & maybe go to Wal-mart in the morning. Anyway I'll be glad to see if I get more money on my S.S.

NO - $1051.00 - had wine &
watched YAR then slept. Got my S.S. check then decided to go in the morning & pay bills etc.

My Dr. visit was fine. My age was supposed to be .02 at the breath test but I made 4.5 - really good - came home - watched YAR - wine supped & then over. Wendy's case in over a doll -`,"2006b__00104":`walked me to my car. Said my front tires are low—will have Mike check tomorrow—maybe after I cash my check—

(Sat Dec 2) Awful night—up and down 4 times—finally up at 6:10—will get ready & leave after P.O. call. S.S. was $1051—as usual—nuts—oh well—had good talk with Jan—her mom fell & broke her arm—poor lady. Yet got my old scale out—176—not 181—I knew that other scale was nuts—

Its 1:20—I mailed Jane package and got stamps—went to 1st store & got a cute package for Wyatta birthday bear—but earlier—cashed check at Wal-marts—got Mike grey jogging pants—coffee & cat food.

Mailed Jane present $4.00—Spent all evening on wrapping & wrapping mailing packages—I got lunch & fries at McDonalds—hardly ever do that—`,"2006b__00105":`Want to do a wash tomorrow & clean up the Apt. It is dirty! Need to wash sheets for sure.

11:35 Pooped! Quite a day! Got all my packages finished except ones needing 10# in. Need to change some 20#. Did a wash after waiting 2 days. Times came back & back killing me. House much better except floor. Sleepy—so guess I'll sleep in chair.

5:15—Had a great time at Norton's—started in back room—only one playing—so "NO I"—then a couple Terry & Tom come out to shoot pool. He was loaded and fairly obnoxious—kept telling her how to shoot. I told him to shut up & sit down. He barely but her, but told me to shoot her—I did when he said he was 47—I said I was 83—he got really loud about that. Said he wished I was his mother—he "hated" her. Loved his grandmother who was gay. Ha—Anyway I shot pool with Terry & finally beat her.

Monday—Dec 4

Dr. today at 11:45—left leave at 11:30—washed & put up my hair & ate—poor R. still has a terrible cold—sounds awful—we didn't talk long. I taped (got) the worst TV "adventure" I've ever seen—I think it must have been a "spoof"—it had all the clichés except I knew what was coming each step of the way—a waste of talent (Noah Wyley) & money. So bad it was funny—the end was just like "Raiders" with "ghosts" flying through the air & finally Sheba "Temple" on fire & falling down. Last scene they kiss & the guys "of all the gin joints in the world she had to come in mine" I puts on his hat—"Casablanca" & "Gilda" & hope it was a spoof watching "Rockford"!`,"2006b__00107":`Had to wait for Dr. about an hour. Maybe that's why my B/P was 164—tried to get out of my stress test but no soap—Ha—then Dr. said I could wait until middle of Jan.

Talked to elec Co. she said surely be coming down—they are going to make an appt. to come "tap" into my electricity & lower bill. Good, watching YAP—The stupid nasty NAZI crap is still on—& of course the murder story. Eeeek—A real Ball at Club—Sat by Boo—we won #1 until Stacey & Agie came in. But last game (I had 4 beers & switched to water & cheer curls) & was 3rd. Left 2 under glass & coaster—Ha—

Then she wasn't there when I called—Ha—her garbage had blown all over the streets and she was getting it—anyway feel better about the tests.

I read in the paper that this lady is collecting blankets & clothes for the homeless. So—& got these 4 blankets out of the back room & 2 heavy sweaters of brown and one of mine—also that old winter coat—3/5 length London Fog—so I called & left my numbers, writing "Rockford" for seen it.

Had a lot of fun again—Boo & 6 "boys"—& won 2 games. Then Boo told me Stacy was living in his car (again) so I had tried him about these blankets & Red told Karen to take them.`,"2006b__00109":`down tomorrow but not stay.

Need to get a magazine to take tomorrow and a fruit bar. Also get a "People" mag. Almost ate a choc. square—Each—$1 in my $5 hr. time zone. Watching "Frozen"—Always cute. Mapped from 11 to 12:30—watched`,"2006b__00110":`Victor is toying with Jack - had him arranging flowers Japanese style - to make Jack think he's still goofy - really great! - and Devon is heading again.

those cars thundering down on me -
so I pulled left and out of the`,"2006b__00111":`corner of my eye saw this car moving over to my lane - I swerved over or I'd been hit! Finally parked & went into 2 wrong bldgs. Finally found the right one - at 10:20 took me right in on a table - took

15 min. My bra got tight & glasses heavy - so glad when it was over - After 20 min took me in & electrocardiograph + B/P (64) & then injected stuff - I was really uncomfy, chest tight - funny feeling in my eye area - hot flash but over in 5 min. Great nurse kept me posted - then it was over - she brought me coffee - I ate my cheese crackers - read - 1/2 hr later back under the camera for 15 min. Then it was over - there was a cute little coffee shop on the 1st floor - I had coffee & seafood salad - 6$. Ha - was it good? Came down Main St. got wine at your store - Joey - I don't care.`,"2006b__00112":`wine tasted awful though, don't want to get it next time not going to bar - too pooped out.

6:15 - Nice little nap - watching "Ellen"

Always cute - mailman not here yet & Cold & windy out - guess I'll get mail in the morn.

I called Shawn - had a nice talk - & think he was glad I called - Collin plays the trumpet & Connor is in sports - the trampoline & stuff - Shawn was off 6 days & that helps - before he left he said "thanks for calling mom - I love you" - I said "well thanks honey" - So I guess I better be sure to call more often. He's been having terrible heartburn - wine? or onions?

In gro store - ran into Marcie - she & Bill got married - bought a motor home & are going traveling. We hugged - Pawka is still in Bar. Guess he told her he should come to Martinez & look me up. Ha! - I'd walk out if he did, & just remember her name - Marcie -

Good News!

Only took 5 hours for Jan's operation! Instead of veins from her arm they took a flap from her forehead & pulled it down over her nose & eye cavity. No Intensive Care & maybe home this weekend - Super!`,"2007b__00045":`Wed - Sept 26

(Monday Nov 5) Up at 5:15 — really cold.
57° — feels great.

I just had the stupidest dispatcher
had to give him my address 6
times — he didn't act like he ever heard
of Palm Lake Village or even Dunedin —
almost said "Oh forget it — I'll get another
cab company." He then — to get my
name & telephone not said O.K. — I said "Hi
see them at 2:00" — I Hope! What a
joke! I'll get ready after JFK.
I went to Winn's got some wine to
drink at YAR — won't be driving anyway.
I'll get ready at 1:30 — that will
give me plenty of time — found out if you
give your birthday when you getting booze
they don't need the damn key!
Eye deal a mess — got there at 2:45
Saw Dr. at 4 — lots of exams & nurse — and a big surprise. He is
leaving the old implant in there!
Asked if I wanted him to fix`,"2007b__00079":`astigmatism so I could read without glasses - I said
"How much?" $350.00 - I said
"Oh no Doc I'm one of your poor patients" Ha - met a nice gal
that was intrigued by my being a twin - Called Carl (cat guy) but
he was way up in Tampa so I called Yellow cab No. 6 got a giddy
guy so glad to get home!
Time - Nov 6 9 at 6:30 - in
middle of nite staggering & so
dizzy - OK now -
I'm going nuts - The Bellview
Surgery Center is on Ponce De Leon Blvd.
Can't find it anywhere -
Nurse just called about tomorrow
& Dr. will call Carl (cat) - I
called him - will be here at 9:30
(too early) I went to Sheila's end
Mike was there - told him about
oper. to say Sheila could take me
not sure about Sheila - not if
she's only one that can admit patients`,"2007b__00080":`I didn't —?

Wed Nov 7. Got ready & Carl here at 9:30 — I waited until 10:30 & they got me in — a gal nurse did all the tests — looking at bright lights — blinking + "open wider" going — anyone about an hour — then Carl brought me home. Nurse told me can't use a cat — need a relative — Povesh — maybe if she can't I'll get Karen or Maria.

Thurs Nov 8. Not a bad day — checked trims, fluid — guess it's OK. Then couldn't find keys — thought & felt my stock pockets but must not have because they weren't there, went to Winn — toilet paper, coffee wasn't breakfast rolls — at drug store left off eye drop presc. — found out acuter was only $10 something. I was afraid it was $40 or $50 — got them later — now if Sheila would call & say she could take me I'd really be relaxed and happy.

Had a good nap — went to Hortons for supper — had coffee + beef Philly.`,"2007b__00081":`beef with potato chips - $6.25
1.50 for coffee - left 2 tips. I
bought 1/2 of it home. Called Jan-

and is on strong "vicodin" - asked
Dr for OxyContin but he said no

I need to see if Sheila is letting me go up. Hope so.

I worried about it last night & couldn't sleep—called Sh. this morn.

She hasn't answered. But nice little Pat offered to take me. May take her up on it—pay her gas—but would she work as a "relative?"

Watching a TV with "Nick" on it.

"My Stepson—my Lover"—with Rachel Ward—a murder story—Nick is Joshua Morrow's very self. I ate the beef tips & gravy—really good for $5.99—at one going to mop.

Popped & then decided to go to thrift shop—looked at a lot of clothes—not XL—mostly M or Petite—

Got back at 3:30—ate the roast beef—had wine—a goofy Raymond on—where Robert dates a black gal—and starts talking and dressing black.

took a shower but there is
nothing to hang on to in there!
Now I'll wash my hair. Going to
wrap presents—I did touch it.
Also the bird poop on the glass`,"2007b__00108":`Well— I'm pooped—I did the most of my Xmas stuff—got 4 good looking plaid shirts on sale—were $9.95 to $7.99—got XL for Mike L, XL for Sh.

Sun day—Hide here today—stood this is boring & a big responsibility`,"2007b__00109":`I slept lousy & had to put cat off of bed - I went to bed at 6:00! Roped out - up at 5:30 - I think my feet hurt at Wal Mart because of these non-support shoes - so I'm finding my tennis shoes to wear.

Went up to Wal Mart and got a cute outfit for Sheila - tan & black - a neat T-shirt for P. Rose & lady bugs - still want to get her a mouse.

Sheila just called me back after I called her on my cell phone. They will be in at 8 tonight - good!

I went up to get dog food & wine - knees feel hurt so bad. Honest mopped - wrapped a few packages. Drinking wine - stumbled on to "Monk" show - probably saw them all - Ha.

Monday - Dec 10 - Couldn't get to sleep last night - couldn't find the cat!

Got my phone off. Also went to Grandma P.O.—mailed Jan’s be present then got diarrhea but at least asked about soc sec check—oh yes—it would honor address change—good.

Cat is again missing - I walked all around outside - Almost 12 - Sheila also cooked out - Ha - Be glad to have it be tonite & no more eye I guess -

It's quite a day! Carl got here at 3:20 - the ride down was $22.00 (Only $25 before) gas here $7 - luckily no co-pays at home $35.00 - It seems they are worried about the pressure - gave me drops (one a day) Pred a poore every 2 hours - Acute - 4 times a day until gone -

Wed - Dec 12 Up at 6:15 - I have the house to myself again - I decided to`,"2007b__00112":`just give Dana's family 100. bill to spend as they want. Got a cute card to put the money in for Dana.

Also got a cute plaid shirt for R. Got a good flashlight (2 of them) for at night.

Had a weird night - after a long nap I decided to go eat - but not at Snappers - first went to Wal Mart & wrote a $85.50 ck for old electric bill - then wanted to eat at that Cafe up there - well - it was closed! So came back to the "Carbon Cafe" - some weird "baked" chicken (more like pulled pork jerky) - rice + green beans - coffee was 10.50! No more of that - then the sproty died - I got lost in a huge "trailer park" I was about 4 blocks from from where I thought - finally got to Broco + got home - at the cafe cafe I only had my broken glasses - got home + Mike went out & found them on my floor -`,"2007b__00113":`Thursday Dec 13

I woke up at 7:00 by Rollin - I thought it was Dana - He said "Sorry to wake you up - is Mike on the way?"

Back hurts - (Hate this job) "Trainer" is on about the perfect "butler" - Last one about Mike's heart operation - quite touching of course he gets O.K. Need to fold Sheila's clothes from Dryer

Went out after nap & got some great $59.50 tennis shoes - then a drink & peel shrimp at Snappers - Home Ellen - phone messages said Patti & Marjie Mike called - Called back (not there) watching Ellen

The kids are going to a`,"2007b__00116":`party—a lighted boat parade—but it's way down by St Pete & I said no thanks—& maybe get some wine & play here—

Vendome—Super—

Ashley came over & we had a good time looking at my albums—She had her little chihuahua "Talia" with her—I thought they were but guess not—Oh well—

Talked to R—he had a hilarious Church program with his grandkids—a scream—TV has article about proved & ice age etc.

Monday—Dec 17 COLD! Had to pull on big cover—it was 39°

Not sure if Mike was here—We talked—they went almost to Orlando for boat parts? & were a little`,"2007b__00117":`worried—especially when a phone ping around 8—finally took a nice shower—on coldest morning ever—Ha—Mike turned on the heat.

11:30—Well—had to sit in a cold car an hour but got the last of the packages mailed—At that silly P.O. that didn't open the other day, I was on time. The nice people there let me go in first. I said "Good thing you opened today—we were ready to blow it up." But the kid working there didn't think it was funny or say "Sorry" or anything. My 2 packages cost $16.05. Can't come & watch "Matlock"—I called Howard about neighborly ride—He doubts if they come this far north—I'll just get Carl—my cab driver—at least I'll have money then Jan 4—

Watching a "Haunting" show—kind of goofy.`,"2007b__00118":`"Price Is Right" - on now -

she called them - maybe I'll get my glasses early?

It's 6:30 - a gal named Marilyn called to tell Sheila she was sorry she wasn't there when I stopped & that she'd bring breakfast in the morning. It's 20 to 7 & no Sheila yet - she got here with whole chicken mac salad & pot salad - I felt "sickish" yells? - I didn't eat it all

Tue Dec 18 all I need today is a clock that glows in the dark -
and - don't know what I did with the flashlight? - need it - found it in kitchen - a good spotlight is on - saw before of course -`,"2007b__00119":`I'm down to 3.00 + my hundred - guess I'll break it.

Got 2 wines - but Karl & Rollin are tearing out the ceiling in their bedroom - I opened the other bottle of wine. After let no shell yet -

Not sure what is going on -
She came but no supper - So I just ate some orange slices & bed -
Mystery solved - it was pizza - I did had a slice - Good!

Wed Dec 19 Up at 6 - My cute little clock light comes on if you squeeze it - really cute - I'm going to call paper & ask to get up closer to house - also call eye place if they are ready & I want them quicker. Today would be swell. I did call the newspaper & ask to get paper by the door. He said he'd be sure to tell the boy -

Now it's 8:40 - stupid eye glass`,"2007b__00120":`don't open until 10— I called & they said glasses were ready. So I went right down— some goofy guy telling his I waited 1/2 hour then said is anyone else here?— my glasses are ready—
NO— we are both busy— do you want to come back? I was joined & said I don't want to but will— I went to the Bookstore and had a roll & coffee— back in 45 min.
Glasses are really cute & NO charge—
had $40 (just in case) guess well can pay that— so my $139 glasses cost me only $30— I wore them outside got really dizzy so took off— I'm wearing them here now— Y&R on after 1/2 hour now Both dogs here with me— I am so glad I've got my glasses gold frames & only cost $30! gold

She got 60$ for cat to eye clinic on Little street & back— doubt if its anything near that much—

Thur - Dec 20

My cat was apparently out all night. I need to look at the outside bathroom door or it opens. Then I think he got out when I looked for the paper - stupid kid put it in the middle of the lawn - almost fell again. Note - So everyone at work. I washed my hair but need curlers may go to Wal at 9-

Jan called - Damn she has more bad news - her mom is in the hospital with lung cancer - AND - her goofy daughter said her trailer burned down - and so she won't be home - (I doubt if it did) poor gal - her stock isn't doing her much good -

I just called Hosp. - yes that bill was paid - Ha! I need house slippers. Finally decided not to have those slippers & gave me. I am now watching YSR`,"2007b__00122":`Good! - Having a wine - then call R & a nap.

him.

Thank heavens—rushed them to Albertsons to get more—need a debit or cash card—and 1¢ a day I got from a machine!—I got coffee wine & crackers Paul & Rollin were here—this a Fox—we like to flirt back forth. I knew something was up—no food cooking—they went to eat out—asked if I wanted to go—said "NO"—bring me something—I think Sheila is getting tired cooking for 2 other guys (of me)—don't blame her! Well 4 more days until Xmas—hope I get a little more money—down to about 10¢—don't need anything—Read the paper—went 8:15—& got rid of one big box—then another one because she bought these long plastic "under bed" holders—these my bed is too low—will see—

(Thu.-Dec. 27) Up at 7—everyone gone to work & took dogs out & let cat out, last night I heard noises and thought it was a radio`,"2007b__00130":`but then my cat making moaning noises - it was another cat out on that cabinet outside my window. I took the flashlight & said "shoo-go away" it did. My cat was scared of it too. My back hurts - I dropped that huge old box out. Had 2 or 3 B.M.'s & my back got OK.

Day started icky - couldn't find dogs, the stupid bathroom door opened again. Got up and pretty fast but no Dudley for about an hour! And my back hurt so I took a strong pain pill that made me woozy.

Monday Jan 28 69
never understand my daughter!
As bad as she was at the yest. & barely speaking she left 2-5$ bills
for me! I waited to see if Mike got
it but he didn't — Anyway my
favorite day Monday — It's chilly —
went up — got wine at W.M. &
whataburger eat W.S. & got chips at W.M.
Couldn't figure out why I kept
almost falling over that strong jean
pill! After I got out of W.M.`,"2007b__00166":`Couldn't find my car. I even parked in some same place - it looked too clean - Scary feeling - no more pain pills - Stuffy drew Cary on - then YAR

Had a good nap - NO Vickers check.

I found an old number but didn't get them. Maybe because of Med. King days? Tried to call - had 3 diff. numbers but no answer - still feel odd (from that pain pill?)

Good supper - cool cake, roast cheese & Lima beans. I think OK + talking again. I told her my ck didn't come and maybe it's run out. She agreed.

Tue. Jan 29 Up at 7:30 - may take my change up (if no check) + cash in & go to O.C. Nice long talk with R. Waiting for YAR - then more.

Then mail - I ck I hope - 24 hr. note for Mike "Poo - don't forget to pick me up at 5:30" - Ha -

He's home & I asked if he saw her note - Ha - I took change - only $25.00 got a cheap wine at Albertsons $3.45

Home + TV, I got another stupid letter for Tom - may call Deniz & get his`,"2007b__00167":`Folks Omaha address.

I looked up phone numbers—found Jack's (my friend) number & talked to him—very cute & funny—Jan not there yet—
Tomorrow

Wed—Jan 30 I was hoping it was
there but maybe my Vick's ck.
will finally get here today?
I need to call pharmacy to see if they
have pills (cromprozel) for me—if not I
need to call Dr. & have them call it in—
watching an old "Monk"—where he
gets Daniel alive, then "Frasier" news
I YAH—then mail to nap—
Forgot about "Price is Right" Drew Carey
is a bore—all he can say is "It's on the
nose" or "strategy"—today I think
he's drunk or on pills—just goofier
than ever!

NO Check—I have .50—HA—really
down—went to thrift shop & roamed
around—my right knee really weak &
hurt—came home—I may drink
one of the Lurines & think Mike`,"2007b__00168":`in home - he wasn't - I opened this "Sparklin" raspberry by Verdi - Big pop when I opened it so guess I'll be O.K. Made me "sickish" too damn sweet. A good monk - but I saw it twice already - ate mashed potato gravy - not hungry - 2 more hours of TV then bed. A girl (Julie) that Sheila went to school with is going to Marco Island so she & M. are going down this weekend at least I'll have money. (I BETTER)

(Then - Jan 31) Up at 6:30 - Mike still here - no paper - I ask him to throw it up if its here - He brought it in to me! -

Last night in bed I remembered the Wal-Mart pharmacy tel. number is on all the bottles of pills! Spent a lot of the day trying to get it after 9 AM call and see if I have pills. Also call Hanson - need celebrex & omnipriol - Please mailman bring money! Ha!

Scale said 169! Less than I've weighed forever. Not sure why - Becker`,"2007b__00169":`4:00 PM - "Monk" I've seen 2 or 3 times -
I am pissed off - no OK - I called it
after 20 min., they said if I don't
get it in 7 days call them they'll make
another - that it was probably because
of change of address. So - before she
leaves in the mom. I'll get a $10
or not -

Sheila's home - put water in my
my eye that is hurting & maybe has a
broken blood vessel in it - feels like
a piece of gravel in it - a cute "Monk"
I saw before.

(Friday Feb. 1st) My thoughtful
daughter saved me again! A bottle of
Clear Eyes out on the counter.
If my check is here I'll give the $20 back
what a doll! - Got gasoline 10¢ of
orange slices & wine @ 2.69 at Wal-Mart
came home - heated up corn beef & pot. Had
wine - watching the "funniest" Tucker
ever - where Red Niles carries a
5 pound bag of flour around as a
"baby" to see what it will be
like - of course "kills" it over and over.`,"2007b__00170":`drowns it sets on fire etc. A root, how
I'm wondering about my S.S. check—
Nuts—It's a short conspiracy!
No check—I called post office—they
"heard" there was a shortage of envelopes
for the checks—Pleeeze—She said probably it
be here tomorrow!
Nurse Sheila just called from Dr. Hanson—
her samples for me—closed tomorrow—I said
she come Monday noon—good!

Last—Feb 2 Day off to a good
start—had a nice shower—
cleaned table from clutter ate toast—
I have $6.00! Plenty of gas—
May use to go to Chicago—my
eye is OK—going to wash my hair
soon. Everyone still in bed (of course) it's
only 8:30. Checks Come On!
Lots of excitement & bad news—
& found out why Sheila was late. At
a nurses Conference in Your City while
going to dinner Sheila tripped over a
brick sticking up & broke her elbow.
Popped it out of the socket! She called`,"2007b__00171":`Mike & he went over & they still hadn't operated on it. Give her lots of plain shots & pill to knock her out while they get it. It's in a blue sling & cast - she wouldn't let anyone tell me thinking I'd worry too much. I did wonder why no one hopes for supper - when she gets off the phone I'm calling the post office to see about $5 checks. Probably Mon - maybe today.

Well - I got a ck @ Vickers 33¢ cashed at Wal-Mart - got wine & creamer. Went to O. Chi. - 3 others playing "me" - winning all - I was a low 4th of the 3rd & after 4 beers I won! Beat "me" - "Bridget X-factor". Bartender made a big deal out of it - I ask "ME" if he was coming in tomorrow - "Early" he said "I'll be in later" I said - Ha! Bill 6¢ left 8¢ - Ashley here - ate rest of her good Greek Salad - watching TV at 6 w/ Psyche & Monk - then bed - Psyche was cute - now Monk - then bed -`,"2007b__00172":`Sunday - Feb 3

Up at 6 - read paper had coffee toast & b. food. Guess kids aren't going to go to see Sheila's friend Julie too much for her arm & think not that what I think counts for much - ha - well - tomorrow should be great - my SS has to be here - not sure what to do all day - ?

Slept until 4 - then up to O.C.

All alone at the game until we came in. I beat him first game - then a friend named "Rabbit" came in. Beat him too until last question + he beat. Him though + Rabbit said I better come back. They come in their feet that he said. I'll see. Came home - kids in front room - have ribs chicken in oven. Of course I have spam "cheese goldfish" but tomatoes + pudding. Football game at 6 - not sure whose coming. Up go to bed at 8 - sure my SS check will be here - or I'll be a mess.

I drove over to Hanson's nurse. I got my celebrex pills - asked child to get me a prescription for a walker. She said (snotty) why do you need a...`,"2007b__00173":`walker? - my balance & knees - if I have a press, Medicare might pay some of it.

Went to W.M. & got wine - went tax - try to remember that.

2/18 said (after 20 min wait) should be here tomorrow - anyway go to watch YAP

Kids home - not sure if workman comp will pay or not - or when op is - am pissed off about my S.S. ck.

Tried to call Eye Dr. but office closed - will call in morning - at 7:30. Will call Sharon - Sheila has supper in oven - good -

Tue - Feb 5 well - trouble in Paradise!

Everything I say to Sheila seems to irritate her - last night went out and ask if she was going to work? "What?" no - I have about 03 months time off coming - I'm writing to see about operation - so I've decided just stay in here here and don't talk - Sort of he`,"2007b__00174":`The "invisible" woman & quiet guest—
if I ever get some money I'll go to O.C. after my nap & eat out—
I will worry if no check today! just
watch TV—drink wine—eat out—low
profile—sad—but may work—
Big deal with eye—can't get a
ride so we made it Feb 15—at 1:00—by then
I'll have Ashley help me find it.
Something is really wrong with Sh.
acts like she can't stand me—just stuck her
head in the door snarled "phone for you"—it was
the nurse—now I'm getting ticked off—a good
"Monk" that I've been about poisoned
candy bars.
Stuffy Drew Carrey on—a nerd—
all he says is "guyman" "joo" on the nose"
and she's using "strategy"-
I'm coughing up a storm again
Well I've hit low bottom—stole coins—
from the kids huge bottle of coins because
NO C.H. AGAIN! called local N.S.—
she pounded STUPID—"I got $5.28
went to W.M.—got $3.18 bottle—
Home—pretzel & wine`,"2007b__00175":`Happy as can be—(HA) I called old P.L. & asked if (by a long shot) my SS ck—was there—They wrote return to sender—so—it would take—5 days to get back + 5 to get here—NUTS—

Kids are home—Mike was working on her bandage—Didn't talk to them + won't—

Only 7 but sleepy—going to bed—

Wed—Feb 6 At least talked to She about ck + she loaned me 20¢

Will get 10¢ gas—save rest & may go see Ida today—+ whoever is in my apt.

I saw Ida + "Jim" (guy in my old apt.) asked about SS ck—he didn't see it. Asked if it came—to take to office + ask then to call me—I was dizzier today than I've ever been—Ida started talking religion—She is a Jehovah's Witness + likes—Even gave me 2 "booklets" to read about Heaven—Man!

Told her I want religious—couldn't promise`,"2007b__00176":`to read — I won't — HA
1:00 — She there — they may not have
to operate!! — that's good — no ck today
NUTS — guess I'll call them again!
I was napping & Jon called — she's
home & fine — close to talk to her — watching
a goofy "Hunting" show,
after it's over I'll try to call SS
again. NUTS

3:00 AM
Well — slept for 4 hours and it is now
9:00 at nite! I thought it was morning.
So I made coffee but will go back to bed —
THAT'S IT!

Anyway—bills are all paid. Revising
Mont & House—mark a screen! So
seen house—

It's 1:00—I ate more calzone & had
wine—slept in chair & now I feel
sick—eating crackers—I went to go swim if
I feel better. Felt better and had a good
swim—I was going to go to Shirley's thrift
but it was raining so came home—at a sandwich
I had some wine,

Forgot to write—I talked to Sheila
She had a scare coming home—the
airplane suddenly went straight up for a
while—then the comp went out & captain
knew that would make them come back on.
She said she called Debbie & said "Debbie`,"2007__00015":`you know I love you." Ha! - anyway, I worked & they got there OK. They never got to NY. Did the seminar in Phila. It's been raining all night.

(Sun - March 15) Slept until 6:45 - great. It's 10:30 & I just got back from groc store - saw a lot - no meat except frozen shrimp - Only 14¢ for a lot - just have to be careful what I buy. Just got a hold of Denis. Didn't hear from him for 2 days - he had volunteered for a film show festival. He was asleep so I let him go back to bed. Ate most of Calzone + had milk - no wine - 11:00 - sleepy - will sleep in chair. Had a nap but went to bed to nap by at 12:00 - did dishes threw out papers etc. Went to Martini - had a cute bartender named Kendra? anyway when she drank her shot I told her that's how Karen got fired. She thanked me and here was mostly water! Then this really nice guy (can't think of his name) sat down & started talking.`,"2007__00016":`He was interesting - in navy for years
on sub - lived in St Pete Russia for 3
years - we had good talks - I had 4
beers - no wine today - so far - ha -

frozen food for me - a young friend of
hers always buys way too much stuff
then doesn't want it! - Have me lots of
food - & Jill eats - looked at one - it
said "eat or freeze by Dec 5 2006" - & I
threw it out. Just realized the Birthday

a cute card and will take it up the
morning put in mail box - also got wine -

Up at 5:30 - usual routine - I'm going to ask druggist about eye drops - not sure about today - bar probably - just saw "Krazy" AKA Eddie Michaels as announcer on Mardi Gras in Dunedin - he's a good (if cotny) narrator - sounded worse - some pretty good floats.

Took mail over & had my March bill from Cable - now $41 instead of $36 - nuts - tried to take one of my 100 bills - 280 left - not much - I got some special vitamins for eyes - 18¢ hate to spend that much but if it will help - good + worth it. They cleaned my air cond. ducts today.

I had a huge laugh - he carries the ball up to the line and barely rolled it. It slowly rolls down the lane bumping...`,"2007__00020":`from side to side & knocked down 1 pin so

Monday 12 I decided to try Brothers Bar today—Really close drafts $1.50 & now they have the game. Saying "Goodbye" to Gerald a good idea probably. Maybe I can get Bob up there at least I'll try—it would save on gasolin—it's closer and safer!—Already 8:45! Great—12:10—Felt lousy for awhile—so napped.

Little Idea gave me a table—brown by brown & shelf & 2 doors—I put it for the phone & let looks great—also moved "pelican" table around. Put those 2 "ice cream" chairs into back porch.

Watched "Lost" gets more & more weird - I'm watching everything I eat! - So far spinach toast & a coffee. I want to get some buttermilk - a baking potato - 5¢ gas

Did do that - had my knee wrapped - so now have 1/4 think of gas - $5.75 - obviously no bar today. Ate baked potato slice of ham - took 1/4 of an oxy codone & slept an hour - Almost 12 - Called my pills in. Can get them tomorrow at 3 - Then I'll go to Bar - I have my knee taped up.`,"2007__00042":`Fri-March 30) My knee is worse—I took pain pills & am putting moist heat on it.

Takes a lot of nerve to walk—more & do the walk the better though. Well—I drove to the office & borrowed a walker!—Helps a lot but then goes the bar—just as well—I have exactly $6.00.

Well—I'm about hit rock bottom, & counted my ones wrong—had 6¢ not 5¢—anyway got a small wine—the card said $3.99—the stupid clerk said $99! So the came back $4.29—& still knew it was $3.99—sort of embarrassing. Came home & think Brian called—this mt. said "Are you there? Are you there?"—sounded like Brian—phone needs to be on hook—then I'll call him—not sure about bar—could call Jill & see if I can play mon.?—`,"2007__00043":`Brian called while I was gone & said "Are you there?" Are you there? - I called & told him to call me. He did - concerned about Dennis doing his income tax - has enough money for a year - good.

I was brave & went myself - good girl - got meat pork steak (on sale) $2.20 coffee (special) $2.00 wine $4.24 - had to go through price deal on wine - O.K. yesterday - but got away with $8.90`,"2007__00044":`also decided to keep my cart here too. That way I can carry stuff. My knee is better the more I use it—rather odd. Maybe those pain pills kicked in—? It's 10:30 & I'm hungry.—dipped baked potato, pork steak & wine—watching people who "hoard" things getting rid of them and getting new rooms redone.

I called Shawn & thankful kids for cute card they sent.—sent to "Grandma Mary" at the wrong zip—storing to be a long day. Had a nap—It's 3:20—about time to eat supper. But I can go to bed at 7—

called Sheila & told her about knee—making hummus & potatoes & corn—watching TV about a psychic finding a little boy lost,

5:00—watching a cute movie with Broderick Crawford & Alex Baldwin & Tony Shaloub (as a gangster) Not really making a movie but trying to catch the gangster. This show is hilarious.`,"2007__00045":`Sunday - April 1st

9:30 - I already a goofy day - three awful - bit got dressed & rushed to go out
Cashed check - I got $40 dinners
eggs - good bread milk - Sheila called

just talked to Jan - She loves her
eye patch - and Grendyl really liked it. Told
her I'd send the other one, I just
found a box to put it in. I think
my knee is better or its the wine or
the pills. I thought Myth Buster was
on but its about crab fishing`,"2007__00046":`I have $20 - 5 for gas - 5 for beer + 10 for Eddie if he comes in. Then I'm in $8. Only paying till 60$ not $90 - I'm watching all my pennies this month - no more 5¢ left for 3 days! I hope May and R. go to mail back the 26th -

(Mon April 2nd) Last month check was here on the second - that would be nice - took a pain pill - hope it helps. Really need to wash my icky hair. Guess I will. I did wish it just up - also went to store - knew better but of course had cart - got wine & TV dinner. Watching "Matlock" about clowns I saw it before, forgot who killer was.

Check here! Great - got gas at 71¢ on way to Wal-Mart - she asked if I got milk for rent but didn't have list of other ones so came home to rent. Also Jill - 10¢ for Fri + today - Sat by some guys invited me to know something but didn't - Anyway, heard he talked me`,"2007__00047":`out to eat. Came home & made 2 TV
shows for supper. At 6:30 at
7 will go to bed. Tomorrow I'll pay
all my bills and figure out my
money.

Tue April 3rd
My knee killed me
this morn - took all my nerve to
step on it. At 8:00 took a strong
pain pill & got enough better to go to
work. Wrote money orders & got
a book of stamps - then I took
rent up - came home - wrote out
bills & pushed cart up & mailed - I
got a book of stamps at gas store
too - and put a lot on Jones eye patch
& Shown envelope - so now I have to
find a cheap cat rabies shot (at humane
society) don't need a physical - also
going to get off of little bill - I used $45 &

May it should be into $30 - I may
get cat extended until May -`,"2007__00048":`since OK try then? - a funny "dormier" where he goes in her room. Twice when she's taking a shower - so funny. Once still awful - will play in chair & make baked potato steak - getting pretty tired of that meal - decided no martini unless I call for it there or Eddie - one win $10.

Went to bar - Boo, Eddie & Wisher played the game - gave Eddie his $10. Boo took 2 of the pieces of the statue - said his "boss" might buy it.

Took my pain pill - decided to get pizza delivered for lunch. Also see about getting a wheeled chair to get around in here in the house - Pill making me feel odd - its 9:00 - feel better - watching a "matlock" - I see a set-up coming.

It was a surprise - different guy - anyway got a chair at the thrift shop for $9.00 but it doesn't roll on the rug.

Went between bedroom bath + kitchen though - Trying to decide if to watch TV or sleep.`,"2007__00049":`I snoozed in the chair - then watched Y&R - man - we think (R + J)
Dorcilla got killed - she fell into
a stream of water & Sharon too!
I got a TV mag & it asked "Do you
think Dorcilla should be replaced?" So
that's the deal on her leaving. What
about Sharon? Anyway - it's exciting again.
I forget to wrap my leg & it's just as
good - so I won't - I got some sleeping
pills.

Thur April 5
6:00 AM
Up at 5 - pills worked
good - slept until 3 - potted &

But then she has another test to put dye in her lymph nodes through the eye & then her cosmetic surgery. She got the other eye patch & loved it! Also said she thought Brenda was a doll & looked like fun. She also told Jack about me taking that you can't putting it in the car. She said he cracked up laughing.

Pork steak & rice - watching TV show about an erupting volcano. It's raining - good. I couldn't get out & carry water for the flowers.

Bed at 8.

Friday - April 6

Can't believe I slept so good (without sleeping pills). Only toilet once at 2 - and didn't take my pills - then slept until 5.

Up at 5 - knee awful - propped on chair. Fixed scrambled eggs & crackers & took my pain pill - haven't gotten my paper yet - guess I'm stuck at home again.`,"2007__00051":`Pill helped enough I think I can go to the store.

A scare at the groc store - no carts in the lot! So I parked by Hallmark store curb + got one on the outside carts. Got 10 cheap TV dinners, a sub sandwich, 2 loaves of bread, a big pizza & some mashed potatoes. Taped a hilarious "Fraiser" to send R. Decided not to send it - too much work.

Ate + took my lunch pill. Went to get my mail this aft. But no car. I called + asked paper guy to get my paper to the door on Sat. I knew that I had a knee op. He said well see.

7:00 - went to store - wine - cat litter + garbage bags - came home - had wine - 7:00 watching TV until 8 - Sheila called - said she'd come down tomorrow + clean cat litter + throw out trash. Also having Easter - these all go. My knee feels better - pain pills I guess.`,"2007__00052":`Sat - April 7

Up at 5 - let cat in - he was on porch all night - & sleep better -
Made coffee - knee little better - cool out -
Jan sent me the cutest card - a
little fat cat hugging itself - "just a
hug - just for you" - "just because" - what a
girl - I'll call her today - need my
pill.

Sheila was here - sweetie gal emptied
& fixed my cat boxes - & thrown out
all my trash. She reminded me these
pills are anti-inflammatory & took away my
swelling in knee & that's why it
feels better. I'm having sub - ham & cheese &
Doritos & wine - watching TV re-doing
people's houses - it's fun - taking a nap at
11:00 -

Slept until 1:00 - too much wine - feel
better but knee better! At 3 went to
Club - just Kendra & me for 2 hours & then
3 gay guys came in with one older gal -
They were so attentive & playing up to her
I asked the guy next to me if she had money.
He said "no - not at all" but & know
she did. Had on diamond & jet earrings.`,"2007__00053":`Arguing the guy next to me went into a lengthy deal on what its like to be gay (not bad he said) I do hope it doesn't become a total gay bar—well we know Boo & strandl aren't—Ha—
I read the paper—got up kitty cup—ate egg & toast & woke my
wife & she wrote a little—nothing
like it did. I hope she got me a cane.

What a deal!—Sheila filled up
my car to just full!—made a wonderful
dinner from pea beans olives dev eggs
choc fruitin strawberries cake—when I
got home a cup Cake & cute little
plastic jelly bean with 20$ in it!—
also a neat 4 prong cane! What a
gal—

Went to Bank & both lines really hurt! They were so nice they got the stuff from him too late last night - but today sent him E-mail that they'd take care of it. Came home & ate & finished wine, watching "Froster" - so cute.

At drug store got my pregabalin pills & a cute key chain for Jan - one with a coin in middle that turned around & said "Clearwater Beach Florida" & "Hitchin' Post" & "Florida Imprest". Mailed it - not sure if I'm going to ban probably will - or at least some more wine. It's raining - NUTS

It's funny - I turned over to "The View" & "Kilos" is on - David Hyde Pierce He's on stage in a musical! Ha -

Think I'll go to library & take books back - I just don't read anymore -`,"2007__00057":`Went to Wal-Mart - knee terrible - but got just 2 eye patches. Working on one now.

(Thu - April 12) My knee is worse than it's ever been. Pain last night probably didn't help - so I have ice on it. Got coffee but not sure about paper. Got the paper but it hurt. Called Sheila & asked her to take me to E.R. today - she said to try Maria & Dana - it would be faster. I'd rather have Sheila though.

Russell just called me - he called me at 8 last night but I said I was "heading out" - I meant to bed. Ha - we had a good talk - just ate dinner & some wine - put in a call to "Sheila" at Hines - ask her to call me or I'd go to E.R. - watching a cute "Frasier".

Russell said he had both knees replaced - and I'd feel a lot better if I did it - I have a call in to Dr. - Knee feels...`,"2007__00058":`OK - wine or pill? or both?

Well - a busy day - I called Sheila (nurse) & finally after I told her I would go to ER. She set up an X-ray slip at the place on 19th Tampa, but to sit there 1/2 hour - then stand on a little stool & she took 4 X-rays - when I got home - I had 5 calls from RB. Poor kid was so scared about my feet being gone. So I guess I'll call her after YTR.

Mike called - poor April is worse - moved to a bigger hospital. Red & white blood counts down - bleeding internally - I have her phone no. I'll call her Sat. noon. Watching "Without a Trace" - They are always good but never talking.

Friday - April 13 Up at 6 - put frozen vest on my knee - took my pills & knee is so much better I can walk alone - so I put my hair up & am going to bar at 3 - need towels & to see friend - or Boo - yesterday - I didn't have a map!`,"2007__00059":`Stayed up until 8 — watching Price is Right —
This knee is nuts! It was so good until I went out to roll car windows down & it started "catching" — came back in & iced it — not sure about Bar Knee better — had shot & pop —
Watching YTR —
Just got back from Bar — held Boo & had lots of fun + 5 beers! A guy gave me a pizza when I took home & am eating lots of fun —
Boo walked me out — ate pizza —
Bed at 8 —

Sat - April 14
Up at 6:20 — good
Knee some better — I had an idea about my knee — maybe I hurt it when I fell in the Bar last night
Also I know I had to fall on my knees really hard — but could it take this long to hurt? I'll know soon, or

Up at 7:00—Fanny
Told yet, the little foreign lady that
speaks really broken English knocked
at the door while I was talking to Denis.
All I could understand was "your car
running?"—But said it like a question.
I said "yes" she said it again & then
left. Then Russell called & we were
talking & Pat said (in the window) "my
car is still turned on and
running!" So I went out & turned it
off—My God—I could have run
all night! Poor lady across
the street—"thanks I'm nuts I`,"2007__00066":`guess! — I finished your book & am sending this mom. Also getting pills at pharmacy — I have #160 left for 11 days.

a detached retina! She had a 2 hour
of last nite & the poor kid has to
wear a horrible thing to keep her head
down for 10 or 7 days — I guess there
is a gas bubble holding the eye in
place to make the eye pushed where its
supposed to be — guess R lost it "last
nite" on top of Linda Emil got so bad —
lost his equilibrium — had to be helped to
chair, R said if she had to go somewhere
she couldn't leave him. But he took
Margo (daughter)
R just called with good news —
Linda doesn't have to wear that on her
head — guess Eliza knew a gal that
had to & she thought Linda's hubby said
she "did (he's nuts)" but she doesn't`,"2007__00068":`Well—met Sheila & she only had 12 more. That goofy nurse at Hansen's just gave me pain pills not non-inflammatory pills.

Sat - April 28 - well - took my first 2 predmores - now we'll see if paper said some people change personality - feel really happy`,"2007__00076":`Depressed etc. I'll watch — Jan called the cabin phone gave out! off all site. I'm pissed again at Ruth — I asked Jan if I told her & was on preliminaries — she said "No but Ruth told her" — now that irks me so I'm not telling her anything else until she told Jan. She's trying to steal my friend — HA — No way.

An amazing thing just happened! Some church members of the pastor came around giving away food! About 30¢ or 40¢ worth. I was throwing out garbage bags & stuffed soil. Are you guys collecting or giving away? He said giving down over there — gave me 3 huge bags (like canvas) of food — soups — desserts — jam — pickles etc etc. And then he said "Would you like to pray with me?" I said "OK." Would you like to ask for something?" That my knee gets better?" & he proceeds to ask God to heal my knee!! I said "Amen" too. My gosh — miracle! He wants me to come to church — oh no!`,"2007__00077":`Guess I'll just stuff away,
not a bad day — Put the
stuff away — mapped an hour — Watched
TV — ate TV dinner (bug) and decided
to go the thrift shop — got a table
cloth for the broken coffee table — a
ten pillow — maybe for her embroidery
flower — Not sure — Maybe on a
jacket or blouse. Anyway found a
beautiful silky bright print skirt — $2.00!
Then went to Norton — they don't
have the game anymore! But — Karen
was there! We had a great talk.
She tried to show me the thing to
do — but she didn't have her glasses
Couldn't see good — but

To turn off.`,"2007__00078":`Sunday - April 29

Up at 7 - took good shower - leg OK except once in awhile - when I bend over or push or pull furniture! - Don't do that! - I decided to make Ruth's crib into a frame.

Went to Wal-Mart but forgot phone battery - way too many there to get. But got dish soap and rags - a bag for vacuum cleaner, not sure it's the right size; got paper towels then stopped for wine - came home changed to shorts & top - ate 1/4 of sand. I got at Morton & opened my mind - took my pill - when I came home 3 cop cars down the street - I asked a guy - they found someone dead in bed - I think it was that real screaming guy with the little dog - not sure. Also a fire truck drove by this morning - Oh nuts!

Watching a cute show - 2 teams trying to make artificial "giraffes" and reaching a tree first. If looks impossible - cute.`,"2007__00079":`I went to Wal-Mart — got soup paper, wash rags for dishes, bag for vacuum cleaner. On the way home, I came wrapped in chair — watched a "Matlock" I already saw — then "A Fish Called Wanda" — about 3rd or 4th time — did a washing.

(Monday — April 30) Up at 6:45 — 20 till 8 now — at 9 I'm taking emb. to cleaners and get a frame at 1st store. Need to tell R Ilos number + show how long "Diagnosis Murder" was — so stupid! Determined to fix my back porch + scrub kitchen floor — took my first pills. I called Anna but left a message but no answer — what's with them? Went to 1st store — no corn nuts or pretty frames — went to Bealls & got one for $7 — got socks at 1st store — made chicken sandwich + wine watching Fraser — talked to R she agreed that "Diagnosis Murder" was stupid + bad acting.`,"2007__00080":`except for Michelle Stafford—she played a cheap floozie—but it all stunk—I went to bed at 8:30—it was on until 9—

This Frasier is a hoot—Daphne dates a guy that looks & acts like Niles.

I feel sick—I haven't had any wine or food except that canned chicken in a sandwich—I think I'll throw it away—Eat a baked potato and scrambled eggs—

I just called Russell—what a nut—all sex talk but Jan did call him this mom—because he called her last night—She was going in today for 4 days—Russ told me at least 4 times he loved me & always did—that he didn't like my having all the lovers—ha!—I said he should talk—he always had girl friends—He also said there were people in Omaha jealous of me—that he was wanting to go to bed with me again—I said "Come on down"—Ha`,"2007__00081":`May 1st - Tue

get in there! Had fun but 2 weird people -
a skinny old girl with a tight new look in
dress & cut up on her leg with a sales ticket
hanging on it. She finally went in put on
jumps & a T-shirt. Then the kid next to
me sat for an hour without a drink -
I looked over he looked like he was
eating! Jill said he was auditioning
for a friend of Harry's - then Aggie`,"2007__00082":`Camp in—then Joe & finally Frankly—they all kidded me about sex—finally told Aggie to "Stop It"—he left at 5:30 & got groceries—called when I got home & said "Don't go shopping when you're drunk"—Jill said "OK"—almost 7—then at 8—bed—

Tuesday May 2 Last night another nightmare! Ate till starving too late and went to bed 1/2 hours later. Horrible bile! So took a pill & sat up for an hour. Then then slept until 7:30—Today is pay day so I go to Wal-Mart & need a few things too—watching a goofy "Myth Busters" —10 after 11—ate pork steak + pota—some wine—It's funny today well—what a shock—NO 55 check—& stopped the mailman—Nobody got them—(only 5 or 6 people) if it's not here tomorrow I'm in rent trouble—(not really) But I wonder why it's not here.

Sounded super. No stitches. They closed them from behind—a tube in her throat through. She thinks it went well—going home tomorrow. She said a Dr. she didn't know said "There's the lady with the pretty eye patch."

A friend in Omaha made it—she made him tell her where he saw her—in your Dr. office and I admired your spirit!

I keep losing weight—I'm not sure why—something to do with eating early or my pills.

Dr. called in more B/P pills to take in conjunction with my other ones—why?

I'm an idiot! Yesterday, was only the 3rd—no $$. Chicks' wasn't insured.

Poor mailman—I got him all worried too.

Here today for sure.

Not at all sure about April - I told
him he has to get her back there or at
least find out about where she is. Also
he said he takes 2 Elevens a day - takes
a month or so to start helping.

I'm not sure if I really want to go. Not only do I have a short time my back starts hurting but I still think I'll try. After all there will be three. The whole trip I'll wear my white placket shirt and my old cotton house coat just trimmed oh no. I like my 100% silk.

Tempe gambling instead of the boat,

stuck - I'll see -

Sheila is here (wait to get cords)

did get an e-mail to you - but
I still have to learn how to
use it - so tomorrow I'm calling a
company company right down the

Good ole Mike sent $80.00! So I got gasolin' good wine—just hub a nap & then wrote R—talked to Jen—her eye wont move or close—poor gal—no muscles or lid—wrote her an e-mail—she gave Teddy Figueroa (gay Cuban from Cuba) my phone number—then fine—she funny.

Watching Rocky Myth Busters—All about the shark on films—Having wine—watched some funny thing of queens—now Myth Busters again—looking at vodka trees—plops frozen dark rock—`,"2007__00112":`May 27, 2007 - Birthday -

Up at 7:30 - when the phone rang I said "Happy Birthday" - pretty sure it was Ruth - she said "you beat me to it" - so I opened her present - a pretty colorful shirt - lots of blues - will wear today - read the paper - Monk is on all day on 25 - good - are we even then all.

Yes first 2 I've seen - fat man murder in high-rise, eaten by a little kid -

3:45 - Back home - Ashley & Leon & Mike & Sheila - she was driving that van from the loop, we got in a horrible slow car mess - on the way to Clearwater Beach - but we finally got there - (it was the same Sheila Ryan)`,"2007__00113":`Leahm & Wyatt were, and Sheila & I were — really beautiful! — I had a glass of wine & shrimp & mushroom pasta — a salad — brought half of the pasta home.

Supper was probably $15 or $10 —
Had a great birthday — ended just in time — I'm pooped. Saw all these monks before —

Mike just called to say H.B. & then Dana! — I'm getting a little hungry again — will eat some of my dinner from Sheila —

funny - If Ashley gets here I'll ask
her about Sheila's mood - "Frasier" on -

shows - so funny

I think I overloaded on cough
syrup - it said no alcohol or grapefruit
but I
didn't read that until later & slept all
morning - another nap from 2 to 4 - you sent
me a "quick" "dad" article - hope that
stops - Ashley is supposedly coming
over around 5 - Hope so - put up hope
oil in - get me on internet - etc.`,"2007__00115":`Still wondering about Sheila? Maybe Ash will know.

Ashley was a doll—did all that stuff—said Sheila made me a card & must have forgotten it—she put on oil—cut my hair (cute) just dropped in front—showed me e-mail ADD—said she'd get my mom's ring to send her.

Kind of stones names over a book—and I now have an address book—well—

She kissed me twice—I told her "I always knew you'd turn out to be a wonderful girl someday!"—and she has.

We said it's a bad place to own anything because of the drug wars between the drug lords — you can't get a tax write-off anyway — unless you have a business there — that Belize is a lot better place & safer. After Brian wrote me I'll write him about all this — Aggie is going to Brotherson a lot, & still don't like it.

Well I'm a lot better, at 5 went to Sheila— She was at a retirement party but Mike gave me $20! — Hooray — Ashley was there — she'll be 23 on her birthday — just a kid. We gabbled while (she back on 10 hours) & I came down — got wine at store on Tampa Road & then small ham & small fries at M — $1.90 — so good too

I think I was having alcohol withdrawal — seriously — I was depressed & tired —`,"2007__00144":`I just spent about an hour talking to Denis - he called sent money should be here tomorrow - good - we tried sending messages but no good - maybe tomorrow.

bad - Better than giving blood -
watching "Tracer"`,"2007__00150":`I just had a big laugh! Looked at the pawn slip—everything is wrong. I hid my old Carefree address—old phone number! And I was a green-eyed blonde that weighed 120—Ha—Now I know I can get 20¢ at end of month for only 5¢—

June 30—Saturday
Last day of June—now the heat starts—huts.
I was watching Peace Brown knock on door—I guess bringing around "purple food stuff" from a little church that gave me food before & shared a prayer. So I held hands while they prayed for thanks from me—Can't hurt.
There is a huge book box of choc whiskers—I'll take to Sheila & help them—they are neat guys—but religion isn't.`,"2007__00152":`What a day! Ashley & Sheila came down gave them some of the stuff I got—while they were here, Ida came over—asked if I got lots of stuff—gave me a lot of hers—and she wouldn't pray with them—Ha—I did—Asked for a 10—she gave me a $5 but Ash came back & gave me $15!—I'm going to get some fish for supper and maybe more wine—Only later—it's way too hot & sticky now—Got dish soap wine & milk—and at med.—fish sandwich & fish—

When I got home Rachel called—she's having terrible back spasms—asked advice—I said "muscle relaxants" + moist heat, maybe pain pill—she said thanks + we left. I'm watching an old "Matlock"—they use the same actors over & over in different roles. Kind of disconcerting.

Had long nap—up at 4. (wine?) anyway ate & had some tomato juice—feel better—a goofy Dr Phil block gal that stays in bed 18 hrs a day + does nothing. He had her mopping a big floor! Called R + she is better. She was glad I suggested muscle relaxants + moist heat—

Feel good - slept good - my new sleeping pills worked. I'm going to clean up this house & at 12 o'clock the kitchen floor. But you make it nice.

Be glad when story is over!

Took most of my garbage down...5 bags still have some - my bird it. Ran into Jeff - told him "I'll see you at 1:30" He said are you OK with that? I said "well I was kind of insulted - I know you have to check full cords & alarms - but how in a mess floor can you?" His reply - this girl was all around new & shiny - that's my problem.`,"2008b_00091":`Anyway - they saw me up & taking out trash - It's only 8:30 - these ill vacuum.

It's 10:45 - I mopped but floor still looks icky, mop is a mess - we just had a stupid fire alarm go off. Sounded like the phone at first. No one came to get me - guess it wasn't a real alarm or fire. It's 11:00.

Well - Jeff & (cute lady that works here "Allison") were here. He was a jerk & just said this was brand new & he was upset about "shine" on kitchen floor - if all 98 spots went down hill I got dirty - rent was low & should afford someone to clean. Really insulting again. I'll get Sheila next Sunday to bring carpet will use mop & blow - I'd hate to move again or pay more that $294.00

Well - I feel better. Loretta came up & gave me a letter - from Jeff to the other jerk - she was sweet - said not to worry about it - get someone to do it. She knows 3 ladies that might. - Or I'll move.`,"2008b_00092":`Then I'll call you together.

Things are looking up! - I went downstairs and talked to Elmo - she offered to get my mail - when she came up I told her about Apt. Deal. Upshot was she offered to paint two rooms (after Xmas) and said she'd get a rug so I will! A red one!

Sheila is taking kids up to Bowl at 5:30 - come back about 7:00 - I'm so sleepy but love seeing kids - I feel better about everything!

The 23rd last night was super - Sheila & Mike got me at 7:00 - everyone was very helpful - Dylan is just precious! Not chunky at all - dark blonde hair, pale blond & curly - Precious is what she is & Wyatt smart & cute. Blow out his candle & told me he was 4! I was surprised when Tommy & his girlfriend (Lacy) were there but I greeted him & said "Have you learned your lesson?" He said "Eye" & gave George $10 (it was his Birthday too). Dylan got boisterous & tried to step on Wyatt's new first tooth & I gave him, we all said "No No Dylan."`,"2008b_00093":`and she threw her dog & carrier (that I gave her) down & went away sulking.

12:50 - just had a spooky thing happen. I was napping & a male voice said "Is anybody here?" & knocking on the door. After I got up saying "I'm here" I was taking a nap - NO ONE was there! What's going on?

I had a glass of wine & 2 white castle sandwiches. So I got up & have looked in the hall 2 or 3 times. I don't want to tell anyone! Started to watch TV but it's not good - so what to do?

And something I won't again - went down for mind at 2nd Malcolm Inn at 4`,"2008b_00098":`That crabby old Jewish gal said "no one likes me" - I asked why do you think that is? maybe it's because you are so negative about anything. Just had a plea for money for cops & an ad. Pokey, just sent them $64.

She's on 10 - she told me. Dr. said she had "water in her leg" - maybe edema or water on her knee - not in her leg! - She's borderline "diabetic" - guess I'll be too. I'll give her that dragonfly necklace for her birthday & a 50¢ Coffee please!`,"2008b_00140":`Ann Marie told me there in a gal that will shop for us. Great! - I'll get her.

Article on TV about Einstein - what a brain! Talked to her (she has goodies) - going my shelf bring tomorrow.

Well - had a short exercise class. Tired out though. I thought maybe Sheila would come over today & get me but maybe not. I thought Myrt Busters was on too but it isn't - HA -

4:00 - blowing my bldgs. is on. No good-

Nuts -

Guess I'll call Sheila at home - message? No - guess not - try to get my glass of wine. Asked if I needed gum. "Price is Right" is on. Well then was different. I helped make strawberry short cake - cutting strawberries up + chopping. Sent 2 home (whipped cream on top) really good. Watch TV for awhile - I wonder who called me earlier - Jo or Sheila? - then I'll find out. It was Sheila - I thought she'd call - but I talked her into going to Hemingway's tomorrow instead.`,"2008b_00141":`So I can look forward to that all day. Took her guilty conscience a little longer to kick in—how wonder what for supper? Glad she alone again in this room.

Had a great talk with Denis—there are vacancies opening up in St Joe. So Sheila is wrong. Denis says it looks good. He's calling Sheila—great!

Friday—March 13

Woke up sick—nice mirror (I made beads for) knew it & brought me medicine—after I ate a little I felt better—still belching. I have to feel OK tonite to go out with Sheila. Will wear black slacks & sweater—going to "Hemingway's" to eat at Wal-Mart for nail polish etc.

I thought Kurt was ignoring me but he just bought my wine—good! I hope lunch is. Can't wait until tonite—need to talk to She about Denis's call. Sounds promising—`,"2008b_00142":`Am ready to go. It's only 3:40 —
BP only 102. Put on makeup & look
a lot better.

5:00 — Finally got a glass of
wine — Sheila — where are
you? That cute black
cat finally made up to me &
let it out. Come on —

(Sat March 18) Yesterday was great! Sh.
here at 6:00 — went to Hemingway — really super
food huge piece of lobster & a
steak — (for lunch) glass of wine — lobster is
great! — $30.00 — wow dinner $65. I paid.
then to Wal Mart — got 2 milk jugs,
4 mugs, carrot cake & dry wine — Carries
home — Of course Sh. just doesn't stop to
think — had to have a personal O.K. person for
me! — Oh well — In O.K. — Had a hallucination
again & thought someone was sleeping in
bathroom closet — pretty! At 11:00 — I won't
bother Sh. until next Sat. — Got lots
of mugs & new dry wine — Cop at Uncle
room that evening. Not surprised / hack`,"2008b_00143":`Mon - call Loretta - hope mail is there waiting for me!

Church to exercise - 9 to 12:10 - Sat, 7:50 - I called Maria & asked her if she could get me some milk to take me to get my mail - need $8 Ck -

Del (nurse) brought me a glass of wine - NO 2 - supper soon - (won't be any lobster?) I hope not - Hall, tonight - still not sure what it was.

Got more wine - good -

Sheila told me if you don't have Medicaid it's $700 a mo! Here -

Sunday March 15

Need an envelope for April - Roy's office - I hate Sundays - maybe I can get a paper somewhere - It's 8:38 - too late for toast & coffee - good hot coffee - so I'm set -

Sheila surprised me! We went to Woolworth - got a new white purse - 100¢ out - paper - carry checks - put turtles in - I called Jim - went out on deck. Had glass of wine.

Myth Busters were on "Now Lost" but I don't`,"2008b_00144":`think we'll watch it until I'm home.

3:30 - just asked for wine gift. I thought and said "Have you had one?" but didn't - good - Maria + Dana didn't pity - Can't wait on Maria - cute young kid said he doesn't all - ha - I made R. the Paris necklace - love it for birthday!

March 17 St. Patrick's Day

Neil's favorite day - no paper yet but I have to work.

Last minute I scared myself & had diarrhea - afraid it was coffee but 2 Imodiums stopped it - good! Now if Dana would bring paper. I've got $15.00 to give him.

Can into Maria - Dana is at home. P.S. Tomorrow.

Exercise class is full of nuts! Sorry put one girl in scared of everything - one so punty - ones hard shiver like an earthquake. One (Ali) vocal about going done. I had a diathermy treatment on my knee. Hope it helps.`,"2008b_00145":`A room full of "monks" — guess I'll get some wine. I did — gone now. Lunch was Irish pate, corn beef & cabbage. I just had my first "jodhpurist" cut my toenails & smooth them down. 2 "clown" just gave me a green bend necklace — quite a day! No paper. Dave stayed home — I think I'll sleep all afternoon. Lunch is over — wandered into "Hymn" singing in lunch-room. AWFUL — if I had more nerve I'd of sung "In the Garden" but didn't — talked to R — she didn't know it was St. Pats day! talked to Jan — she has a "spot" in her good eye. Worried about it — & me not having a good time up there! Wish she'd reply!

Strange thing! — Nurse said Mary want a glass of wine? — Yes — of course.

Wed. March 18th woke up at 4:00 — went back to sleep. Came here at 7:00 — he said there's a new administrator & she's a witch! Just put too in "colored" jacket in closet. Nurse brought me coffee! I just shook off well —`,"2008b_00146":`Things Are Happening! They are moving me to another room (419) + Florida (office) has to call me tomorrow!

So—crossed fingers—am not sure why I'm moving—I'll be in with an (nice) lady landlord—OK!—It's the baby. That's really neat over with osteoporosis (in the back). Also Marice is my nurse—I'll call Dennis at 6:30—I left a message for Sheila. Need my white new purse—

Well—I got the glass of cold water from Sheila—I still have to be accepted by Medicaid—call in at 10:30 in the morning. Sheila is coming over at 9:30—she must be taking time off! It isn't going to be very fast at all!—NOTS—I need a TV!—Oh well—everyone says this old gal is so nice—and don't think so—very unfriendly. I don't talk—can't hear either—what a pair! There is a bird making a nest right in front of our window—cute! But I'm discouraged again—I leave it to Sheila.`,"2008b_00147":`Thur March 19

My "nice" (H/A) roommate woke up until 11. I was up late too.

But at 8:00 - coffee here - well I wrestled with being here versus just leaving - decided to behave myself & do follow rules - "O.B." is odd but I'm in her "circle" bitching about something & will play & bug her. Cute little "nurse" flirts a lot. Fun - Br. here so... egg & biscuit & oatmeal - coffee's good - need more -

O.B. getting her clothes. Whoopee - her purple jacket - she just opened curtains - C'mon 10:30 or 9:30 -

The "Rock" is a long way from here. But it's good exercise - decided not to tell Sheila anything anymore - so just can keep "Cold Water" to herself.

Also - not call Jan - boy it's complicated!`,"2008b_00148":`wanted to write this great day. We
didn't get ahead of ourselves though. We tried.
We (she & I) went to "Pasty Billy" in
Tarpon - it's darling. I had a wonderful
shrimp & wine. She had crab cakes -
lots of people there - so warm, great
day. I had 2 wines $10.00 - how - my
disney room mate just came out of bathroom.
She was unfriendly - I am too - she gave me
her cute little TV - bigger one here -
got a refund check for $158.00 from
electric bill. Good - we put it in the back.
Got wine with meal - mac & cheese,
squash, roll & ham - not bad - I can't
find my nail polish - Nuts!
March 20 - Not a bad day. Had
fun at exercise class - Ramona was
flirting so I said "midnite - my room 49"-
she said "Smiley" thought I was pretty.
Her & she argued. It's none of your business.
She tried her I wasn't - I was "nice"
but I don't care - Ha - Maria is getting
me a glass of wine - She did - it's
good - I knew O.B. would try to
be "nice" - She asked if the white bear`,"2008b_00149":`were mine?" It's here - it's cute but she didn't remember it - not so sharp I guess. I should be nice but don't feel like it. - Ha -

Then said "hot pot salad, stew tomatoes - study for a nap!"

But can't take my pie, for God's sake? - I said "Because I'm leaving?" She said "yes" - Can I?

"Ramona" just oozed in - Poor old gal - really bent over.

Had a nap then went to the Dock - just talked to Denis - he asked if we talked to Omaha today? Not sure - I'll call him at 6:00 - can't remember where that other gal is - why to the end of here - too far.

Ramona stopped in - yaked - probably told him more about Donald and then I should have - oh well

NUTS!

I have diarrhea! Asked a nurse to get me something.`,"2008b_00150":`Guess he is. Better put have any wine and watch what I eat!!

No good TV either — Jossy.

Where are the pills? I went to the desk & got them. Took 2 — that should do it! Also asked for sleeping pills at 7 or 7:30 — got my sleeping pills already.

Belching cucumbers — slip call.

Sheila pretty soon. I did — we won't really know anything until Mon (if then).

She talked to Denis too.

Sat - March 21

Tomorrow is Denis Birthday & think — I'll ask Sh. St. Sit. & no coffee or Br.

Maria & Dana don't work weekends — I had 2 "scars" already — opened bathroom door & there was a "ghostly" figure standing there! Ronnie with no teeth! On the floor in a napkin! — Had that in a glass & on the floor. C'mon coffee!

Br. & coffee time — 8:15 — Good eggs & Cake — Hot coffee — I didn't hear OP come out of the bathroom & had a minor check — Not in there — Ha—`,"2008b_00151":`Wish I could find my new nail polish—ask Sh. Also need to find where box is in the second—
Shine & think—

Need to find a paper. I miss Diana & Murcia.

"Work" is on at 10—probably an old one. It was an old one.

Had a great day. Sheila came over! We went to Woolworth—I got 4 rings, some really pretty beads—then we had gyros (I'm sure) & came home. It's only 6 but I took 2 pills & am sleepy. Had just a lot of balance after. I find the problem for Ramona—ready to sleep now.

Sunday March 22

It's Den's birthday! Call later, the old cat did it again. Left with her—PV on (I went out) & ate only until 11! I told her last night—she got to get another cat at least—Br. here—cold—scr' eggs, cake & oatmeal—coffee good—

I need a paper! O.B. is up—getting dressed—her lil blue "jinnie" have Teddy bear on things. Prima! No!`,"2008b_00152":`I guess I'll make beds today!

Hooray!! Found both of my turtle earrings! So happy! They are in my billfold zipper now.

Then March 26 - Had a victory over old Pat last night. At 10:30 she was playing solitaire - I said "It's 10:30 - let's turn off the lights." No response so I got the remote and went up to the main deck - when I got back down here her little TV were off! Good - I guess she thought I wouldn't do anything - HA -

Maria bought my pajamas & coffee! Need glue to finish her beds. Come on Feb!! O.B. went to toilet - just came out - phew! Hate her!

She just toddled by.

Maria wanted to do my nails. Tried to get her to go outside. My feet nail broke off! Got tired going to the dock - I worry way back - NTS

I'm going to warn her to vote but not do anything - maybe she will move.`,"2008b_00157":`I told Sheila about her cold water on everything—gross—it embarrassed her—but it's true—I spilled my coffee—got towel to wipe it up—the man said "you didn't have to do that" & said if I wanted a bit of tea OK—it did hurt my back—need Kleenex—got TP—she getting me Sunday so I can wash my hair—may take a shower—I'm sneezing & nose is running—cold?

decided to not react to anything O.B. pulls.

Romone said she's bipolar - don't doubt it. Better
stay away & concentrate on her. H/A - O.B. turned
off her TV & lights - when she left, she must
have decided to behave too - good.

Big Surprise - Mike just called me! Shawn gets
his unemployment but no job yet. Please call him.

I reminded those nurses of my sleeping pills -
just had a good long talk with them - he gets
300 something a week - said it's going here there
now & he's sick of it. But he's glad I'm moving to
Omaha - he can drive in 8 hours - he said

Connor is really good on cello & beats him at
Chess & Collin still at piano. O.B. is talking
to me, since we both went overboard last night -
not going to let her get to me - she must be
bipolar or why is she here? except for her back.

So nice talking to Shawn. I'll call him back
tomorrow & give him Ryan's name. Maybe he thinks
Ryan could get him a job. Also - want my
sleeping pills - got them finally.`,"2008b_00159":`Sunday March 29

Need to go to bank - get out money - make airplane reservation - get a suit case - pack tonight - call Denis - already called Shawn & Trisha - will call D at 6 - Somebody (room mate?) is cleaning up the place - maybe guy across the hall - I sprayed "Red" around. Get me out of here!

Wed - April 8

Day started great. Maria took papers to Linda.

I have to take a shower so I will at 9 - then to see Linda - (crossed fingers) then exercise - then lunch - & a nap. I had 2 cups hot coffee - Had 3 pills I'm getting a stool softener - just had it - should help.

Did a huge BM - now a shower - I think Maria is wrong. I think it's Fri.`,"2008b_00170":`Dammit!

Sheila was right, the Florida Medicaid I'm on—hit new (yet) also her name is Clementa—puts so it will be longer! Joey—this is my last day at physical. Good—had a nice shower from Maria—guess I'll never get out of here.

Went last time to physical and disthorme on my knee. Now—I want more wine. Asked for a new roommate—here hoping someone early to bed.

Talked to R. Told her about Omaha. I hope I move soon—like today! Went out on the deck but the wind was cold—came back in—OB was out in the smokers' room on the porch—how she know? I know—Ha.`,"2008b_00171":`Nice talk with Sheila - told her I had to get out of here at least 2 times a week - maybe three & three. We'll see - she said "you need to go by your birthday" HA!

The nice blond nurse brought me another glass of wine (NO.2) so I gave her the beads I was going to wear on the plane. Decided I'd wear my gold nugget & gold earrings.

Thursday April 9 O.B. didn't turn lights out until 11 & followed after. Come on change! Really cold this mom. No paper or coffee - must be Dana & Maria day off - nuts - 7:38 - had French toast & 2 cups - no paper - O.B. hasn't touched her food just the paper - took her 10 min to put her purple jacket on - she's a mess - hope they move me today!

O.B. is gone or in the toilet. They (police) brought in a lady on a stretcher just her in the next room. I decided not to ask what a new "roomie" - it was 10:45 or 11 when I said "TURN OUT YOUR LITE" - & she did. Oh well...`,"2008b_00172":`8:00 - Had pretty good lunch & glass of wine
O.B. gone again - Sheila won't be here
tonight but maybe tomorrow - I'm not sure when
she'll be off early.

O.B. just crept in - He's down into
toilet - I don't think she has friends or
relatives - No one visits her ever, she plays
solitaire -

Supper was fair - scrambled eggs & a croissant
icky soup - beef-bitter milk + a vanilla pudding
Fair - She just keeps yelling and doesn't
eat it - I guess she is nuts -

Friday April 10 Up at 7 - Maria with
papers coffee food - good girl!

Now I have money I'll do this—

1. Make coffee & toast & quiet—

Chinese fish hanging on it. Really cute -
keeping it. Had a nap - it's raining -

Funny story about Wyatt - his
sister Wylynn got a "princess" outfit from her
other gig + had it on. Somehow Wyatt
got it + put it on + came out "Wyatt is
a pretty boy!"

HA - Ryan said "That

hat + they will send a gift of him in it.

Wed - Feb 13

Up at 6:00 - missed Mike -

gorgeous orchid plant + the
funny frog "statue" with bulging`,"2008_00008":`eyes - each 20¢ - also Kleenex

to keep your from off of the wine "HA!
watching "Ellen"

Did it again - way too much
wine - don't remember eating supper
laid down around 7:30 P.M. + woke up at
11:30 - didn't know what time or day it
and I was pretty sure I hadn't eaten
which scared me. I did though hamburger +
baked potatoes from restaurant. I still have to
mail R's package but don't want to. I almost
fell sideways getting the paper -
Mailed the package to R. $2.00
Got a valentine card from April
so I called her - She went home
left my phone number.`,"2008_00009":`Then an embarrassing thing—Mike's friend "Dave" and his wife knocked on the door. Well, Mike was out in his boat + Sheila + Ashley somewhere. Neither one got home and I had to "entertain" them until I got tired of it + just came in + watched T.V. — Sheila came home with a Kentucky Fried spread + we all ate. Ashley came in + watched the funniest "Frasier" ever—where Niles catches Frasier's eyton shoe. A scream. It's 8:00 + I'm going to bed. Ashley found my clock + old shoes under the bed.

Feb 15 - Friday

Weeks are whizzing by—
I'm going to fix up + go to Old Chicago today—after my nap. Ashley is finally going to give me a perm Sunday. My "left" is a mess—not enough places to put things—my dizzy head is worse occasionally + feel like I'm falling sideways + a "monk" on that I've seen twice + once yesterday. I put my hair up. Went to Wal-Mart + got hair spray + vitamins—then post office copied my letter to elec co. + mailed back to April—there was another damn shooting at a college + dead + then...`,"2008_00010":`shot himself - Horrible!

Had a great time at Old Chi -

had a great (turkey cobb salad) lots of stuff
in it really good - spent 15 $ - also
got a B/P monitor - 60 $ - at Walgreens

Well - I guess Sh. Mike & Dave & Jennie
went out in the boat - her little dog is
here & really sounds vicious - a
tiny little pom. Maybe they went to
Torpon Turtle - Don't care - But - I've got
to admit - be glad when they both go back
to work.

(Saturday Feb 16) I still have $415.00
and it's 16 days until new payday - but
how much? - So if I spend 20 $ a day
I'll still have $95 $ - Yet, only Mike &
Dave went fishing - at 8:00 Sheila started
frying steak mushrooms & potatoes - good
thing I ate lunch? - Guess I'll eat at
O.C. - maybe soup & salad - or cheap stuff -
Thinking about getting my car painted -

circles, ivory disks & 3 diff. brown`,"2008_00011":`beds - made a neat long & short necklaces - I'll keep them (maybe) watching "Snapped" married couples that one kills another the other one.

Sunday Feb 17

Up at 6:45 - eternal guests are gone. Don't know why they bother me - I decided I'm not buying any more presents or doing any work (fold clothes) around here. Sheila never says "thanks" or I like those etc. So poopy - Not sure what to do today - More beads?`,"2008_00012":`Rewatching the "Monk" & new yeast. Then gold + Michaels - got neat lg. wooden beads & sparkly bronze colored beads. I'm going to sell for $10 to stores - I hope. Well - Mike told me Ash + Sheila went to the Dunedin Craft show. But I guess they didn't think I could do it maybe not. But I will ask how much necklaces went for - a lot but most were "blown" glass beads - oh well.

Monday Feb 18

It finally happened - I fell getting the paper on my hands & knew then all the way down. If that big bush hadn't been there I would have had to holler for help. So - no more getting the paper - scared me - I'm getting worse & slow - an idea popped in my head - Brian & I getting an apt together - I'd pay rent & Brian food + elec. Things aren't working here for sure - when she gets up I'll tell her. Well - I told her - she's out in the hot tub - I told her I wasn't happy here and wondered if she'd get Brian to see if he'd want to get a 2 bedroom apt.

I went to O.C. had beers and their
great onion cheese mushroom-herb + cale skew

Wed - April 2nd - Brian just took his time book hunting - he got up at 7:45 he's not sure about taking that job - I'm going to check out shorts at thrift stores today, not until 9:00.

Poor Brian - guess his old company decided they wouldn't take him back. He said he's going to work.

We played a game - I (more or less) let him win - I didn't play a big counter but it seems important to him to win - so no big deal.

Almost 7:30 time tomorrow pay day.

Had good nap - until 4 - wine? Maybe - an old monk - the dress designer murderer - & got some good pics of Brian in the back yard - with Odley & a duck out in back - the A/C is not working - Mike said he set it at 79 & it's 83 in here! But he took the boat out & didn't fix it yet.

I got a bee in my bonnet to stay at Clearwater Beach the couple of months until the Capt. Wonder what Lorenzo would charge me? I may drive down Monday & see.

New Journal Easter - April 12

Monday - Easter -

Laid awake an hour last night thinking what this place needs - Something to do that's fun.

You never hear laugh except the nurses talk.

I wrote a soothing paper - Will leave when I get to net. Didn't work so far as to say maybe my birthday? If so I'll let Dana + Marie read now. At till 8-

8:45 - breakfast 2 waffles one sausage and orange juice - ate the waffles - wrote on my lip - can't eat sausage or drink o.j. they're on tomorrow tomorrow - Bonnie still asleep.

Get out of here - I mean food good

10:10 - I'm dressed - new top - tan stock

Did nails - "Dick" still here - in jammies

Teddy bear & purple jacket.

Monday 8:15 -

New week - Let's hope

Had a great day yesterday - Sheila got me at 12 - I held kitty cat about ½ an hour

Doodled all over me - butt head - just has paw on my face! Also Jon called me at Sheila's - he said - Food great from corn

Hot pots - brownie & ice cream. Ashley was supposed to get there but didn't -

Maria just bought cool coffee - nuts -

Cold in here

Maria heated up the coffee - She + I`,"2009_00003":`Had a hilarious time "looking" at my jewelry. Gave her a little silver bracelet chain & said I thought it was the Hope diamond—then she started pinning on pins, beads, rings etc., until I was bogged down & told her "Get away from me!" We both laughed. She left at 3—worked on bead for 2 days.

Tue April 14 I thought the paper was here—got 7:10—But it wasn't delivered on the site—it will be here soon & hope for coffee! I'm asking for a "stool softener" like rocks—

Tue 8:45—had lot of coffee. We are having a terrific literary wind storm—TV off—my mike uncle blowing every few minutes and I have to go to the window!

Wed April 15 It was a tornado not "wind storm." Had good pancakes for breakfast (for a change) got warm & had good hot coffee—need a shower—need to wash hair but no shampoo—Maybe Maria can get some, she did and shower was nice.

Good News!!

I have a new room—3 of us but my bed is right by window & they both go to bed early—no more old cat! Guess I'll call R & tell her. I have diarrhea—from those stool softeners—so`,"2009_00004":`I lay awake all night wondering why I hate this place and what it needs most.

"Something to Do" to "USE OUR RAIS" and have fun. There is no laughter here or activities. Where is the pool table (I used to be quite good), ping-pong table, swimming pool (or at least a hot tub), some funny slot machines—fishing on the lake shore every day. Crossword puzzles, word scramble—so I get gambling? Drinking? Challenges—SO BORING! If you took 6 of New York's smartest CEO and put them in here for months they'd be handicapped too—to here grading.

FOOD—B—once in awhile "ug."

Clean—A—more attention paid to shiny floors than patients!

Comfort—A—don't do anything to be uncomfortable.

Activity—FFF—Camp "Do nothing"

D—never see one around

So what if we get hurt having fun? I'd rather be hurt than numb—I won't leave this note until I'm gone (not dead—somewhere else)—Please get an active "Recreation Director" young & energetic & get some LIFE in this place!

—ANONAMOUS—`,"2009_00006":`Maria said I had another room if I wanted it. And do I ever! — one talks to herself & the other one doesn't talk & they both go to bed early! Best part I get away from Q.B. early in the morning—4:32 (I think) at the end of the hall. Get some emulsion. Nurse said & other genius you diarrhea! — let call Sheila.

April 16

Moving Day!!

Away from Q.B.! Only 6 in ready! — Ha ha — All moved— I love it. I do have a window— big trees birds cars— workers coming & going— No Q.B.— my 2 "roomies" are just sleeping zombies— halfway sick at my stomach— these what? — Nick gave me a TV good color with C.R. — say that left it didn't want it! — bigger than mine! Wow— goofy Sci Fi "Hercules" is on— Maria bought me glass of wine— I need food— water— I hugged Nick— he's a cutie—

Lady in corner asked me my name— went to bathroom when she came out— had a disapproving look on her face. — Nick said her name was Mary Anne— She acts lonely— new in city— in her recliner— It's 12— time for food— don't know if she eat anything— know the fat lady— (not with the red hat) is talking to patient in corner bed— now leaving— 9:45 — went to Dock— Sun was`,"2009_00007":`Hot - I am getting a little too loud at 5 need a glass of wine. Want not need wonder where OB is? Who cares?

It would be nice to have a normal roommate - Even the girl that sleeps all day makes herself happy regularly from 4 to 5.

Friday - April 17

I know what it felt like to starve. Literally so hungry this morning. I begged 3 people for food - one girl bought me coffee - finally quick got me 4 crackers at 8am and 20¢. They should bring breakfast in 15 min. I never would have lasted. But I will get a lot of much food in dinner - Maria got me papers - Sat. Sheila is coming (I hope) Eat at Holy Konga - bring back shrings.

I knew Maria left the papers by the smell of "Oscarin" her perfume - breakfast in 10 min. I HOPE -

Rick brought me 4 crackers - ate them all - breakfast at 8:15 - oatmeal + french toast ate all the toast most of the oatmeal - good they want me to take 2 showers a week - don't want to - at least I get Maria to do it.

Looking for Sat. She. Maria had put my jeans in the "dirty" bag. Wearing Sheila said she'd come about 10 - So funny - the fat lady "Caroline" that I thought was a new friend - gave her my stripped bear I said she could use our front door to go to`,"2009_00008":`take bathroom (we share) & she sent a big
voice over to tell me to turn my TV down!

just matches my jacket! Then she took me to Wal
mart & I got everything I wanted. Lots of snacks
fruits & cheese curls candy bars (tiny milk by way) powder
house - nail polish bombs. $5.4 worth - brought
me luck - Mike is sick at home - Ronnie "talks
to herself" foaming around - makes me nervous -
decided I better go to "wine & cheese" aft.

Had 4 people - 1/2 glass wine & Bingo! what a
place! went out in the sun - hot - getting a little
tired - I asked for 2nd wine - so far no -

Sunday April 26?

Got some good coffee but the nurse didn't make it. Grilled she made it for "her" people (that ate brown there) & snarled back, "Why it isn't a picnic being in here either - I hate it here - Everyone either nuts or dying." She backed down & said "I know it" so I asked taking a cup of coffee isn't so bad; need a robe & slippers to take for here - cold next & guess? Have news on.

Coffee cart is here - so - I've got plenty. Almost 8:00 - Hope I get the paper about 10. Better yet - Sheila brought it at 9 - Milk had bad bacterial infection - Better now - lunch wasn't bad - Chicken - noodles & mixed veggie - pudding wine & donut. She brought me TV about volcanoes - Knock a tea!

What a day! Some old guy in a wheelchair held out his hand for me to shake - tried to pull me over to him? broke away - I now someone (a lady) in coat in the hall hollering "Help me help me" Aahh! - I think it's a matter of time now. Girl with terrible legs - I think she was...`,"2009_00017":`upstairs the first week I was here.

And "Helmet Guy" had his helmet off & was leaning by the railing on the deck. I was hoping he didn't jump. He didn't come walking in. TV "How the earth was made" volcanoes mostly "faults"

Roommate in toilet again. She falls then buck - Hallowing again! - he stands. I'll be nuts before I get out of here.

Monday April 27) Well - I almost started to riot - refused a shower! They sent Maria - a white girl - a black fellow & I finally said "This isn't a jail - I don't feel good (sick) so go away." They finally quit.

In a lobotomy next? Ha - Pat on Clean points.

Still in first bed gone? Hope she stops away! Not in shower - Can't find my scissors.

Maria brought me wine. Said I had every right not to take a shower. Said I would melt.

Poor old "Lady" in next bed has been up in her wheelchair since lunch & showed he buck in bed. I told nurse she is finally putting her back - Called Maria but no answer - At least came in & got washing.

In May now. Hope this is "moving" month. At least 2 offers.

"Nuts" or "gally" is at it again. In and out of bathroom 6 times in 15 min. I asked her if she had diarrhea or urine infection? She didn't even answer me—she ran out again. Her hand is shaking too. Think I'll ask a nurse about her.

At 5:15 still hoping Sheila shows up. Supper was icky—hot dog, pot cake. Will call her at 6:00.

Poor Sheila isn't very happy with me. She got here at 6—I asked her to get me some time to pray (well that put the screen to sleep).

Friday May 1st

Now we are in May—late. Came back from work & water all over—drink spilled—got some more.

Cries is gone—some crazy "suck" noise here—don't know what it is. Some of "gally" room. If it starts again I'll call. I did say "what is that noise?" If it's your attempt I'll let her go first. Will call her tomorrow to ask.

great shrimp—glasses of wine. Coming home we
stopped at a store & Helen got sleeping pills &
Chardonnay for me. We watched a movie that
was cute but I couldn't hear & have a 24-hour

said she was glad I was here. I talked to Tiger
& said he'd go in to see him. Denis had a
lecture on astrology—of Joseph Turner. I
have an apartment! If I get on the code I won't
have to tell. She said Denis said they take you in
van to a YMCA to win—there's 80% a
boy in normal apt—more for a bigger one. Dog & house
my finger crossed. Good news—wife is sending me
money to help buy fur. Sheila thinks I need to get a
haircut & get out of also a red couch.
Had a good lunch—St. made chicken
rollat & apple salad. I told Denis story about
his childhood—and the Ruth & parking deal.
Denis took us to their huge Wal-Mart
for shoes—too tight—traded Sheila for
some nice brown leather ones. Got a few
shorts and some tickets for "Jamie"—6 for 5 panties.`,"2009_00029":`Monday May 18

Oh well - no diary or h. aid -

(Over)`,"2013a_00006":`Just found this

Tue April 16 Talked to Mary & Mike. April OK - good - having beer last night.

TV - "Jodi" trial - doing her personality traits - not good - bi-polar - out of - but not exactly. Afraid she's maybe getting the death penalty. Don't know now - but it was planned - were pretty sure of that.

Dinner lousy, Jim carved my tray again? A nice heavy cut gal (mike?) acts like we are best friends - not really sure who she is. Dry pork chops (no sauce) & dry rice - no gravy - good cookies - It's time for bed for me - 6 o'clock - end. a moo - all you can see is Hummingbird - Oh well - bed time -

Wed April 17 Up at 6:30 - tried coffee again. Lousy - 9 to 7:15 - guess I'll try breakfast. - It was OK - NO B.

As usual -

I woke up wondering where all`,"2013a_00008":`my little baby pics are? Especially the one of Deniz under a blanket & Shaloo, the one that won $500 for cutest baby!

Guess what? They had food downstairs & who walks in but Russell! I said "I heard you died" he said "I did" - But he's on 2nd floor - that's where the mentally disturbed go - what did he do? Anyway after I ate I just got up & walked out & here he came & said "were you on 4th floor?" he said NO - God ?? That's for mental problems or maybe breaking rules?

Also saw Jim but he was very distant & cold so OK!

It's 1:00 - they caught a bombing suspect. Good news soon!

April just called me! We had a nice chat & I told her to call me at eve. after 8 - I have a date that comes on, they caught the bomber - we hope.

Went down & got Candy`,"2013a_00010":`Thursday April 18

Up at 6:30 - another cruise ship engine caught on fire! You wouldn't get me near one - I'm still reeling from Russell being on 2nd.

Breakfast extra good - Regret 2 bacon - Had to struggle to get down milk open - Finally stabbed it with a fork - tomorrow I'll ask aide to open it. Jim left early - ate apple, don't care to L with Russ & Jim.

Big fertilizer dust in room.

It's 8:26 - Man! I can't find my stupid flashlight. I tied it to a cloth belt but it was gone! I'm sure it's under the bed -

So many bad things happening now!

I hope they catch the Boston Bomber!

Now - 4 cars just fell in a sink hole in Chicago.

Boy am I constipated! 2 times in bathroom! Not taking a leap though!

Need to tell R about Russell -`,"2013a_00012":`Wopped - its 10:15 - shoulder hurts -
pretty sure its shingles as it hurts just
like it did.

I'm scared to turn on TV news
or look outside now. My back
hurts enough to keep from worrying
about anything else.

I'm watching a cute fat bird trying
to hang on to a tree branch in the wind.
Oops - he's gone - I need to call R.

Lunch OK - beef gravy over mashed potatoes
& corn, peas (tough) yet didn't.
its now 2:35 - nice nap Jodi

Supper OK - tomato soup + grilled
cheese sandwich watermelon for dessert. Sleepy
now.

really dry throat - I'll check with Sheila.

Good - Caught 2 "Boston Bombers"
one dead - one on the run. They are
brothers! But they killed one guard`,"2013a_00014":`this mom. They are from Russia!

OK - no B and she gave me scrambled eggs - but I got my hard boiled egg.

Police are looking for Bomber #2 - His Brother is dead & I hope he is soon.

They are still looking for him.

"Waterloo" is shut down in lock out "to catch No 2 Bomber"

11:00 - nice nap -

Shoulder hurts! - TV all about 2nd bomber! Such a "pretty" boy for a monster. Tried Pitta phone - too busy

Guess I'll go down & get Cheez-mix -

Did + Smuckers (which I ate)

News is still "survival" as they say.

+ no one who knew bomber ever thought it was them!

Jim Carroll's tray - I told him I liked his shirt but - he is odd - looks like

true + thrown his pelvis forward? what's that?

Almost 1:00 - time for a nap.

2:30 - nap OK but cold. TV on -

Did they kill that thief yet? Hope so`,"2013a_00016":`Also Jodi's trial - she in prison - now
Boston - like a ghost town
I wish my shoulder would get better - I'm
not going to sugar - I have the trip trial back
on.

My "helper" Sherry was here & we had a
good time & talk. She said "Let her know if I
want to go to the gym." Do I?

Sat April 20 Up at 6:30 - they caught
the 2nd bomber - hiding in a van! Ha
But good as usual no bacon - oh well -

basement and just finished - 1/2 hour, came home
"Castle" is on! Good - saw it I think
No - it's just art forgives - now another
one's murder at a wedding -`,"2013b_00142":`4:3 Weather & Time

I find myself thinking more about death than I want to. After family dinner was back—it's understandable.

Can't leave a message for &—guess I'll call him to vote on cell phone.

Good Girl!

Washed my hair.

Nurse came in & gave a strange looking pill—I asked what for? & she said "Diabetes" I said "I don't think I'll take it." The next nurse came in & said it was either Alzheimer's or spells of seizures. But the next pill was anti-biotics that Dr. Silverstein recommended.

Sat Oct 9?

Not sure of day—too early for coffee so came back to write in here. Found another channel—43—

TV is goofy—some channel just stuck with a picture & no movement. Note—I can't exist without working TV!—It's OK—it's 3:30 & I found Monk on 57—& got the greatest card from`,"2013b_00144":`Ruth - a pie (commercial) of all her grand-
great-grandkids - a sweet card that says
"Be fierce & relates to cancer - &
20% in the card. I called her & thanked
her.

I'm debating asking Dr. how long do
I have or not. Don't think so -

Sun Oct 10

just had a laughing
fit with Sheila's. I was trying to
get her cell phone no & getting it
wrong. She'd say Nooo - its --- I'd
say --- & she'd say noooo - So I
said you call me at 10 - same deal for
Ruth only 11 -

At 3:30 - got my first trip
color

Mary popped in & said Earle, in 5
minutes - So I got down there but Bus Driver
took me. It was AWFUL even using a
stick but she got a great big job out of &
manicure! I had a list & even got my hearing
aid - everything is LOUD - I even had a
valium - anyway I hope it wasn't my`,"2013b_00146":`Castle tonic

New hearing aid in - so nice to hear stuff - maybe too much, or I'd get used to it.

Had a good nap - not too 3:00 - 9:00
"Castle" on TV, hoped it's on -
Another "Castle" - I've had 2 wines
Then bed after this is over

The next day
Well slept awhile - watched
Sam & Dean - had some wine - Nurse is supposed to be here - I need stronger pain pills or more -
"Pones" is on - I'm having chex mix & wine - Better quiet wine -
making me sleepy!
Went down & got some jewelry earrings mostly, a cute skull &
red eyes for Connor

The shot
Mary just came in and gave me
a few shots - no big deal
I said down at 3:30 let's go
new "Castle" is on now - or wine
& a honey bun -`,"2013b_00148":`Supper OK—rice & beef + plums
2 Candies + after the show—BED

Wed Oct 13 Be good as usual
Dr here today so I'm waiting
out pretty soon I'll have some wine

Mary asked me where my hearing aid
was—Asked her if she too loud so she
called Roy & talked to ear dr.
She said she gave me the option of a little
box to up & down sound—to tell Mary at in
a separate box I didn't want to bother
with—so she said "try at later" having
a little more wine + watching Bonet
then a nap—Told Mary I needed
stronger pain pills.

Well had nap but exp gal
woke me up—so went down + exp machine
my legs for 10 min then she got walker
+ I said "NO" she tried for a few min's
then gave up & did paper work.
She asked me if she got me up
the range could I get to my room?`,"2013b_00150":`and "Sure" — so I also said "I think I should have to the say over my own exercise" — I came home — Boris is on — I had some wine and a twist — I think "Castle" is on? It's only 10 so maybe not.

& went to supper — OK — Chili and melted cheese sand — John carried it in here for me!

Thursday Oct 14

Lousy but no eggs or bacon, toast & cr of wheat — Today I asked Scott if he knew I had cancer. He said "Yes" but the other day he said "Where you been? I'm missed you" — Love that man. Guess the color.

I've got some love times cards down on P-week — bought them up & sprinkled. Once I run the glue and looked down at my left hand was holding the glue over my clock guide down! Changed & washed them!

7:50

Choked but good as usual. Almost though. Choked on my 8 pills there now. Good story. Pain pill is`,"2013b_00152":`Oct 14

I decided to get some excitement in my life—a happy hour and get 20% scratch off of 20 beers at Harp on Sat night. Bernie can push them—op! I should have some sort of care—after "Bones" at a nice place unless it's Castle.

Well—130—more beer and TV—I'm going crazy—there's no more food—good.

Now how did I find a pan-fish worker? OK—"Castle" is in a stop opera—no one in kitchen at 5—so silent until 5:30.

Supper and late—good Polish sausage & odd cucumber pieces with tiny shrimp—pepper for heart—lid candy at front & lid open—still Castle on.

Oct 15

Bernie came up and 1/2 + forgot scratch off—more thanks—no way.`,"2013b_00154":`Sun Oct 16
